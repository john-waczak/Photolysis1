Here we use a suite of remote sensing and meteorological data products together with ground based observations of PM2.5 from 8,329 measurement sites in 55 countries taken between 1997 and 2014 to train a machine learning algorithm to estimate the daily distributions of PM2.5 from 1997 to the present. We demonstrate that the new PM2.5 data product can reliably represent global observations of PM2.5 for epidemiological studies. An analysis of Baltimore schizophrenia emergency room admissions is presented in terms of the levels of ambient pollution. PM2.5 appears to have an impact on some aspects of mental health.}

	abstract     = {More than 10 studies have consistently shown that around one-third of all schizophrenia incidence may be related to unknown but likely unconfounded environmental factors operating in the urban environment that have an impact on developing children and adolescents to increase, relatively specifically, the later expression of psychosis-like at-risk mental states and overt psychotic disorders. The available evidence suggests that causation (urban environment causes psychosis) is more important than selection (high-risk individuals move into urban areas) and that the effect of the environmental factors in the urban environment is conditional on genetic risk (i.e., there may be gene?environment interaction). The effect associated with urbanicity has grown in more recent birth cohorts, while studies focusing on within-city contrasts have found important within-city variation in the incidence of schizophrenia associated with neighborhood social characteristics. Future approaches may focus on the complex interactions between neighborhood cognitive social capital and genetic risk as the substrate for the increased incidence of schizophrenia in the increasingly urbanized areas that children are growing up in.},

Existing methods detect Lagrangian coherent structures, which are barriers to transport, by examining the stretching field as given by finite-time Lyapunov exponents. These methods are very effective when the velocity field is well-determined, but in many applications only a small number of flow trajectories are known, for example when dealing with oceanic float data. We introduce a topological method for detecting invariant regions based on a small set of trajectories. In this method, we regard the two-dimensional trajectory data as a braid in three dimensions, with time being the third coordinate. Invariant regions then correspond to trajectories that travel together and do not entangle other trajectories. We detect these regions by examining the growth of hypothetical loops surrounding sets of trajectories, and searching for loops that show negligible growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract     = {The General NOAA Oil Modeling Environment (GNOME) is a new tool developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for oil-spill response. GNOME generates spill scenarios that support the NOAA standard for trajectory output by providing both "Best Guess" and "Minimum Regret" solutions. GNOME also serves as a tool for novice users, from high school on up, to learn more about oil-spill trajectories and actually run them. The GNOME model, regional location files, documentation, and training materials are available on the internet at http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/software/gnome/gnome.html. Training courses are also offered by NOAA HAZMAT. Research is underway on how to effectively use nowcast/forecast models as sources of ocean current fields for the trajectory model. Questions of data size, time-step interpolation, and relevant physics are being investigated to use these models as data fields in GNOME.}

The objective of this work is to simulate the oil spill trajectory of oil released from a pipeline leaking in the Gulf of Mexico with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. The model was developed by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) to investigate the effects of different pollutants and environmental conditions on trajectory results. Also, a Texture-Classifying Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA) was used to delineate ocean oil slicks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. During the simulation, ocean currents from NCOM (Navy Coastal Ocean Model) outputs and surface wind data measured by an NDBC (National Data Buoy Center) buoy are used to drive the GNOME model. The results show good agreement between the simulated trajectory of the oil spill and synchronous observations from the European ENVI-SAT ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) and the Japanese ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. Based on experience with past marine oil spills, about 63.0\% of the oil will float and 18.5\% of the oil will evaporate and disperse. In addition, the effects from uncertainty of ocean currents and the diffusion coefficient on the trajectory results are also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.}

Such classifier is based on a sliding window, and has been designed as an ensemble of Cost-Oriented Support Vector Machines (CO-SVMs). More precisely, we have integrated the Incremental/Decremental (ID) formulation of SVMs with the Cost-Oriented (CO) formulation, thus obtaining an ensemble of COID-SVMs. At each data arrival, the new pattern is classified by using a dynamic selection of the underlying COID-SVMs in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space by means of the ROC convex hull method. Then, once the actual class label of the new pattern is known, the new data and the associated class label are used to perform an incremental learning by each COID-SVM. At the same time, each SVM is updated by performing the decremental learning of the data falling outside the sliding window. This allows to adapt the classification to time varying conditions. The methodology has been applied to the classification of oil spills at sea from remotely sensed optical images.}

Classification of polarimetric SAR data can be pixel-based or segment-based. Various segmentation methods for polarimetric SAR data, such as region growing and split-merge, have been proposed recently. This paper proposes a new multilevel divisive hierarchical segmentation methodology based on the separation of the scattering mechanism space produced by polarimetric SAR decomposition methods. This methodology is segment specific, i.e., several segmentation levels can be created for segments selected by the user. In the first and second levels, segmentation is performed based on the dominant scattering mechanism and the second most significant scattering mechanism. In the subsequent levels, data are further segmented using a histogram-based segmentation algorithm. The methodology was applied to two datasets based on Pauli and Freeman-Durden analysis images. Three segmentation levels are implemented and compared with segmentation results based on the k-means clustering. Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) full polarimetric SAR data are used for a study area located in the southwest of the United Kingdom. The proposed methodology leads to promising results and can be adjusted to user needs and existing knowledge of the target area.}

We believe that oil spills detected in satellite images are real, even if we will call them "possible oil spills" because they have not been confirmed by an aircraft and or a vessel.

For this study, we used the Texture Classifier Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA) to interpret SAR data from the RADARSAT satellite and a geostatistical clustering analysis to compare seeps detected in 579 SAR images covering the northern Gulf of Mexico (GUM). Geostatistical analysis results indicate that, in a typical active seep formation, oil vents would be found within a seep formation similar to 2.5 km in diameter. Repeated observations of slicks at a given seep formation indicate that advection of rising oil in the water column causes an offset from the vent depending on water depth. At 500 m, the radial offset is up to 1400 m; at 2000 m, it is up to 3270 m. Observations with submersibles showed that, in 100\% of the cases, the calculated seep formations that are matched with active oil seeps correspond to anomalies interpreted from surface amplitude maps and migration pathways in the seismic data. However, episodically, larger releases from persistent seeps occurred, and also some other seep formations showed intermittent releases. Our analysis indicates that active oil seeps detected with SAR represent a subset of the total array of geophysical features generated by hydrocarbon migration on the northern continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico.

	abstract     = {Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are widely used for detection of hydrocarbon resources, pollution, and oil spills. These applications require recognition of particular spatial patterns in SAR data. We developed a texture-classifying neural network algorithm (TCNNA), which processes SAR data from a wide selection of beam modes, to extract these patterns from SAR imagery in a semisupervised procedure. Our approach uses a combination of edge-detection filters, descriptors of texture, collection information (e.g., beam mode), and environmental data, which are processed with a neural network. Examples of pattern extraction for detecting natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico are provided. The TCNNA was successful at extracting targets and rapidly interpreting images collected under a wide range of environmental conditions. The results allowed us to evaluate the effects of different environmental conditions on the expressions of oil slicks detected by the SAR data. By processing hundreds of SAR images, we have also found that the optimum wind speed range to study surfactant films is from 3.5 to 7.0 m.s(-1), and the best incidence angle range for surfactant detection in C-band is from 22 degrees to 40 degrees. Minor postprocessing supervision is required to check TCNNA output. Interpreted images produce binary arrays with imbedded georeference data that are easily stored and manipulated in geographic information system (GIS) data layers.}

	abstract     = {A rapid, sensitive, and accurate method for the screening and determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in edible seafood is described. The method uses quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)-based extraction and HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD). The method was developed and validated in response to the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Rapid and highly sensitive PAH screening methods are critical tools needed for oil spill response; they help to assess when seafood is safe for harvesting and consumption. Sample preparation involves SPE of edible Seafood portions with acetonitrile, followed by the addition of salts to induce water partitioning. After centrifugation, a portion of the acetonitrile layer is filtered prior to analysis via HPLC-FLD. The chromatographic method uses a polymeric C(18) stationary phase designed for PAH analysis with gradient elution, and it resolves 15 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority parent PAHs in fewer than 20 min. The procedure was validated in three laboratories for the parent PAHs using spike recovery experiments at PAH fortification levels ranging from 25 to 10 000 mu g/kg in oysters, shrimp, crab, and finfish, with recoveries ranging from 78 to 99\%. Additional validation was conducted for a series of alkylated homologs of naphthalene, dibenzothiophene, and phenanthrene, with recoveries ranging from 87 to 128\%. Method accuracy was further assessed based on analysis of National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 1974b. The method provides method detection limits in the sub to low ppb (mu g/kg) range, and practical LOQs in the low ppb (mu g/kg) range for most of the PAH compounds studied.}

Motivated by physical observations of trajectory patterns, we define hyperbolic LCSs as material surfaces (i.e., codimension-one invariant manifolds in the extended phase space) that extremize an appropriate finite-time normal repulsion or attraction measure over all nearby material surfaces. We also define weak LCSs (WLCSs) as stationary solutions of the above variational problem. Solving these variational problems, we obtain computable sufficient and necessary criteria for WLCSs and LCSs that link them rigorously to the Cauchy-Green strain tensor field. We also prove a condition for the robustness of an LCS under perturbations such as numerical errors or data imperfection. On several examples, we show how these results resolve earlier inconsistencies in the theory of LCS. Finally, we introduce the notion of a Constrained LCS (CLCS) that extremizes normal repulsion or attraction under constraints. This construct allows for the extraction of a unique observed LCS from linear systems, and for the identification of the most influential weak unstable manifold of an unstable node.

	abstract     = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to "forecast" the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of "ensemble Kalman filter", in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.

In the simulation, the ANFIS architecture is employed to model nonlinear functions, identify nonlinear components on-linely in a control system, and predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results. Comparisons with artificial neural networks and earlier work on fuzzy modeling are listed and discussed. Other extensions of the proposed ANFIS and promising applications to automatic control and signal processing are also suggested.}

A SAR simulation model is used to study the SAR signatures of various surface processes: wind, waves, currents, fronts and slick. The simulation model is useful in the interpretation and classification of SAR images of sea surfaces. In ice-covered waters SAR has been developed into an important tool in operational ice monitoring. Industrial applications of SAR are under development for the following markets: SAR-derived wind energy maps for the wind mill industry, mapping of currents and front for deep offshore drilling and ice service for Arctic operations. In addition, SAR-derived products for wave forecasting, oil spill monitoring and ship detection are already established in operational public monitoring services.}

The methodology relies on the object-oriented approach and profits from image segmentation techniques to detected dark formations. The detection of dark formations is based on a threshold definition that is fully adaptive to local contrast and brightness of large image segments. For the detection process, two empirical formulas are developed that also permit the classification of oil spills according to their brightness. A fuzzy classification method is used to classify dark formations as oil spills or look-alikes. Dark formations are not isolated and features of both dark areas and sea environment are considered. Various sea environments that affect oil spill shape and boundaries are grouped in two knowledge bases, used for the classification of dark formations. The accuracy of the method for the 12 SAR images used is 99.5\% for the class of oil spills, and 98.8\% for that of look-alikes. Fresh oil spills, fresh spills affected by natural phenomena, oil spills without clear stripping, small linear oil spills, oil spills with broken parts and amorphous oil spills can be successfully detected.}

These reporters are based on the regulatory protein AlkS and the alkB1 promoter from Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2, a widespread alkane degrader in marine habitats. Escherichia coli cells with the reporter construct reacted strongly to octane in short-term (6 h) aqueous suspension assays but very slightly only to tetradecane, in line with what is expected from its low water solubility. In contrast, long-term assays (up to 5 days) with A. borkumensis bioreporters showed strong induction with tetradecane and crude oil. Gel-immobilized A. borkumensis reporter cells were used to demonstrate tetradecane and crude oil bioavailability at a distance from a source. Alcanivorax borkumensis bioreporters induced fivefold more rapid and more strongly when allowed physical contact with the oil phase in standing flask assays, suggesting a major contribution of adhered cells to the overall reporter signal. Using the flask assays we further demonstrated the effect of oleophilic nutrients and biosurfactants on oil availability and degradation by A. borkumensis. The fluorescence signal from flask assays could easily be captured with a normal digital camera, making such tests feasible to be carried out on, e.g. marine oil responder vessels in case of oil accidents.}

	abstract     = {Difficulties in the assimilation of Lagrangian data arise because the state of the prognostic model is generally described in terms of Eulerian variables computed on a fixed grid in space, as a result there is no direct connection between the model variables and Lagrangian observations that carry time-integrated information. A method is presented for assimilating Lagrangian tracer positions, observed at discrete times, directly into the model. The idea is to augment the model with tracer advection equations and to track the correlations between the flow and the tracers via the extended Kalman filter. The augmented model state vector includes tracer coordinates and is updated through the correlations to the observed tracers. The technique is tested for point vortex flows: an N-F point vortex system with a Gaussian noise term is modeled by its deterministic counterpart. Positions of N-D tracer particles are observed at regular time intervals and assimilated into the model. Numerical experiments demonstrate successful system tracking for (N-F, N-D) = (2, 1), (4, 2), provided the observations are reasonably frequent and accurate and the system noise level is not too high. The performance of the filter strongly depends on initial tracer positions (drifter launch locations). Analysis of this dependence shows that the good launch locations are separated from the bad ones by Lagrangian flow structures (separatrices or invariant manifolds of the velocity field). The method is compared to an alternative indirect approach, where the flow velocity, estimated from two (or more) consecutive drifter observations, is assimilated directly into the model.}

	abstract     = {Spectroscopy is the basis to detect and characterize offshore hydrocarbon (HC) seeps through optical remote sensing. Diagnostic spectral features of HCs are linked to their chemical composition and fundamental molecular vibrations (SWIR-TIR features), as well as overtones and combinations of these vibrations (VNIR-SWIR). These features allow for the characterization of oil, oil on water and emulsified oil. This work shows the results of lab and field spectral measurements of 17 petroleum samples yielded from key, oil-rich sedimentary basins in Brazil. Measurements comprised reflectance data (VNIR- SWIR), Attenuated Total Reflectance (AIR), Directional Hemispherical Reflectance (DHR), and emissivity data (TIR). These spectra were analyzed by multivariate techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least-Square analysis (PLS). The experimental results indicate that for the VNIR-SWIR range: (i) spectral features can be recognized for crude oil, emulsified oil and oil on ocean water; (ii) different oil types can be qualitatively distinguished based on these features (i.e. light or heavy), even considering oil on water; (iii) the same applies for oil measurements simulated at the spectral resolution of hyperspectral (357-bands/ProSpecTIR) and multispectral (9-bands/ASTER) sensors. Within TIR wavelengths (3-14 mu m), typical HC spectral features can also be resolved and oil types qualitatively discriminated using PCA/PLS, including both full-resolution spectra and spectra resampled to hyperspectral sensor (128-bands/SEBASS). However, despite the fact that oil emissivity is always lower than that of water, such separation seems unfeasible using 8-12 mu m TIR features only; emissivity spectra are essentially flat for all samples in this interval. This research demonstrated that oil can be qualitatively distinguished based on both VNIR-SWIR and TIR spectroscopy data, with important implications for remote off-shore oil exploration and classification of oil leakages.

Based on local linear approximations of state/measurement equations computed at each sample time, a recursive state estimator providing the minimum-variance state estimates (known as the 'extended Kalman filter (EKF)'') is derived. The same local linear approximation of the state equation is used to develop an optimal prediction equation for the future states. The prediction equation is made linear with respect to the undecided control input moves by making linear approximations dual to those made for the EKF. As a result of these approximations, increase in the computational demand over linear MPC is quite mild. The prediction equation can be computed via noniterative nonlinear integration. Minimization of the weighted 2-norm of the tracking errors with various constraints can be solved via quadratic programming. Connections with previously published successive linearization based approaches of nonlinear quadratic dynamic matrix control are made. Under restrictive assumptions on the external disturbances and measurement noise, the proposed algorithm reduces to these techniques. Potential benefits, hazards and shortcomings of the proposed technique are pointed out using a control problem arising in a paper machine.}

Untreated gray water had high levels of conventional pollutants and surprisingly high levels of bacteria. Both black water and gray water discharges sometimes exceeded state water quality standards for toxicants. The state convened a Science Advisory Panel (the Panel) to evaluate impacts associated with cruise ship wastewater discharges. The effluent data received wide media coverage and increased public concerns. Consequently, legislative decisions were made at the State and Federal level, and regulations were imposed before the Panel completed its evaluation. The Panel demonstrated that following the rapid dilution from moving cruise ships, the effluent data from the Summer of 2000 would not have exceeded water quality standards, and environmental effects were not expected.

The Panel evaluated the dilution of wastewater discharges from moving cruise ships. The results of that evaluation were used in turn to evaluate possible effects on water quality. This paper describes the dilution evaluation. The Panel evaluated a number of different studies and concluded that 1) the water that is displaced by a moving ship creates turbulent mixing upon its return astern of the ship; 2) the propellers further enhance the turbulence and mixing; 3) a cruise ship can be represented as a moving cross-sectional area; the larger the cross section and/or the faster the cruise ship moves, the greater the volume of water displaced per unit time leading to increased mixing rates; and 4) the diluted concentrations achieved will be inversely proportional to the rate of discharge. Hence, the mixing will be rapid, substantial and related to the vessel's size, speed and discharge rate. Based on two theoretical studies and six field studies, The Panel concluded that the cross sectional mixing area behind a large cruise ship rapidly expands to about 4 times the cross-sectional area (beam times draft) of the ship. The dilution factor (df) for a discharge from a large moving cruise ship can be calculated as follows: df = 4 x (width x draft x speed)/(discharge rate) Links to The Panel's final report, as well as interim reports and other related matters can be found at: http://www.state.ak.us/dec/press/cruise/cruise.htm.}

This delineation is essential for scientific research ranging from geologic to environmental impact studies. In a data mining scenario, one cannot blindly discard information because it can destroy discovery potential. In a supervised classification scenario, however, the preselection of classes presents one with an opportunity to extract a reduced set of meaningful features without degrading classification performance. Given the complex correlations found in hyperspectral data and the potentially large number of classes, meaningful feature extraction is a difficult task. We turn to the recent neural paradigm of generalized relevance learning vector quantization (GRLVQ) [B. Hammer and T. Villmann, Neural Networks, vol. 15, pp. 1059-1068, 20021, which is based on, and substantially extends, learning vector quantization (LVQ) [T. Kohonen, Self-Organizing Maps, Berlin! Germany: Springer-Verlag, 20011 by learning relevant input dimensions while incorporating classification accuracy in the cost function. By addressing deficiencies in GRLVQ, we produce an improved version, GRLVQI, which is an effective analysis tool for high-dimensional data such as remotely sensed hyperspectral data. With an independent classifier, we show that the spectral features deemed relevant by our improved GRLVQI result in a better classification for a predefined set of surface materials than using all available spectral channels.}

The Bauer et al. algorithm is very attractive for the possibility of faithful representation of the probability density function (pdf) of a data manifold, or for discovery of rare events, among other properties. Since theoretically unsupported data of higher dimensionality and higher complexity would benefit most from the power of explicit magnification control, we conduct systematic simulations on "forbidden" data. For the unsupported n = 2 cases that we investigate, the simulations show that even though the magnification exponent alpha(achieved) achieved by magnification control is not the same as the desired alpha(desired), alpha(achieved) systematically follows alpha(desired) with a slowly increasing positive offset. We show that for simple synthetic higher dimensional data information, theoretically optimum pdf matching (alpha(chieved) = 1) can be achieved, and that negative magnification has the desired effect of improving the detectability of rare classes. In addition, we further study theoretically unsupported cases with real data.}

The main areas of interest related to such disasters are the following: 1) to identify oil pipeline leaks and other oil spills at sea and 2) to detect man-made metallic targets over the sea. Within the context of disaster monitoring and response, an innovative processing chain is proposed to observe oil fields (i.e., oil spills and man-made metallic targets) using both L-and C-band full-resolution and fully polarimetric SAR data. The processing chain consists of two steps. The first one, based on the standard deviation of the phase difference between the copolarized channels, allows oil monitoring. The second one, based on the different symmetry properties that characterize man-made metallic targets and natural distributed ones, allows man-made metallic target observation. Experiments, accomplished over single-look complex L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and C-band RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR data gathered in the Gulf of Mexico and related to the Deepwater Horizon accident, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the proposed approach, being able to process both L- and C-band fully polarimetric and full-resolution SAR measurements, can take full benefit of both the ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 missions, and therefore, it allows enhancing the revisit time and coverage which are very critical issues in oil field observation.}

The intensity for fresh marsh and forests progressively shifted while saline marsh intensity variance distribution changed with the season. Intensity variability suggested instability between temporal comparisons. Forests, especially hardwoods, displayed lower coherences and marshes higher. Only marshes retained coherence after 70 days. Coherence was more responsive to land cover class than intensity and provided discrimination in winter. Phase distributions helped reveal variation in vegetation structure, identify broad land cover classes and unique within-class variations, and estimate water-level changes.}

The classification performance of conventional techniques can be improved by testing the accuracy of the existing classifiers using a ground data image as a reference. Moreover, a created prototype demonstrates how hyperspectral data can supplement information on environmental deterioration due to oil pollution, specifically the Patuxent River wetland at the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. The data allows an assessment of the current state of wetland losse's and habitat changes due to oil pollution of local waters and associated wetlands. Airborne Imaging Spectro-Radiometer for Applications (AISA) hyperspectral imagery was used for this study and the results derived using the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software. The use of different classifiers showed low accuracy and class overlap for many classes. Therefore, a ground data image was created using maximum likelihood (ML) classification to compare the results of several classifiers and to assess the accuracy of each technique. Using 2D scatter plots for selecting regions of interest yielded more accurate results than digitizing polygons for training samples. It allowed precise identification of grass stress and soil damaged by polluted water.}

It has been used successfully for data of high dimensionality and complexity where traditional methods may often be insufficient. In order to analyze data structure and capture cluster boundaries from the SOM, one common approach is to represent the SOM's knowledge by visualization methods. Different aspects of the information learned by the SOM are presented by existing methods, but data topology, which is present in the SOM's knowledge, is greatly underutilized. We show in this paper that data topology can be integrated into the visualization of the SOM and thereby provide a more elaborate view of the cluster structure than existing schemes. We achieve this by introducing a weighted Delaunay triangulation (a connectivity matrix) and draping it over the SOM. This new visualization, CONNvis, also shows both forward and backward topology violations along with the severity of forward ones, which indicate the quality of the SOM learning and the data complexity. CONNvis greatly assists in detailed identification of cluster boundaries. We demonstrate the capabilities on synthetic data sets and on a real 8-D remote sensing spectral image.}

Dark formations can be caused by man made actions (e.g. oil spill discharging) or natural ocean phenomena (e.g. natural slicks, wind front areas). Radar backscatter values for oil spills are very similar to backscatter values for very calm sea areas and other ocean phenomena because they damp the capillary and short gravity sea waves. The ability of neural networks to detect dark formations in high resolution SAR images and to discriminate oil spills from look-alike phenomena simultaneously was examined. Two different neural networks are used; one to detect dark formations and the second one to perform a classification to oil spills or look-alikes. The proposed method is very promising in detecting dark formations and discriminating oil spills from look-alikes as it detects with an overall accuracy of 94\% the dark formations and discriminate correctly 89\% of examined cases.

In the present work, a detailed examination of robustness of the proposed combination of features is given. The method is unique, as it searches though a large number of combinations derived from the initial 25 features. The results show that a combination of 10 features yields the most accurate results.

Using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we prove that linear combinations of the fuzzy basis functions are capable of uniformly approximating any real continuous function on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy. Based on the fuzzy basis function representations, an orthogonal least-squares (OLS) learning algorithm is developed for designing fuzzy systems based on given input-output pairs. Specifically, an initial fuzzy system is first constructed which has as many fuzzy basis functions as input-output pairs; then, the OLS algorithm is used to select significant fuzzy basis functions which are used to construct the final fuzzy system. The most important advantage of using fuzzy basis functions is that a linguistic fuzzy IF-THEN rule from human experts is directly related to a fuzzy basis function. Therefore, a fuzzy basis function expansion provides a natural framework for combining both numerical and linguistic information in a uniform fashion. Finally, the fuzzy basis function expansion is used to approximate a controller for the nonlinear ball and beam system, and the simulation results show that the control performance is improved by incorporating some commonsense fuzzy control rules.},

Although experienced observers are a spill response's mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. \{DWH\} spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing. Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (&gt;&#xa0;0.1&#xa0;mm) slicks from \{AVIRIS\} (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. \{MODIS\} (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps. Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however, \{SAR\} generally cannot discriminate thick (&gt;&#xa0;100&#xa0;??m) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1&#xa0;??m). The UAVSAR's (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional surface coverage, and emulsification. In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with \{AVIRIS\} and corroborated spaceborne \{CALIPSO\} (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. \{CALIPSO\} and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation. Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as \{MODIS\} thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization???data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH's experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill.}

Spectral feature analysis compared the \{AVIRIS\} data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 2.3&#xa0;??m, which arise from \{CH\} bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3\%, 89.8\%, and 90.6\% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5&#xa0;m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4\% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100\% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2&#xa0;m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the \{AVIRIS\} data to 30&#xa0;m reduced the accuracy to 73.6\% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4&#xa0;m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5&#xa0;m \{AVIRIS\} data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat \{ETM\} data to 30&#xa0;m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, ~&#xa0;40&#xa0;km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11&#xa0;m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21&#xa0;m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey, July 10, to the latest airborne survey, October 4, 2010. The results demonstrate the applicability of high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data to identifying contaminants in the environment for use in evaluating ecosystem disturbance and response.}

Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Cameras are only useful to provide documentation. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits this as thermal energy at temperatures 3???8&#xa0;K above ambient, this is detectable by infrared (IR) cameras. Laser fluorosensors are useful instruments because of their unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice and snow. They are the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Radar detects oil on water by the fact that oil will dampen water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing.}

Recent developments and trends in sensor technology are illustrated with specific examples. The discussion of the sensors is divided into two main categories, namely active and passive. Active sensors are those that provide their own source of illumination or excitation, whereas passive sensors rely on illumination from a secondary source. A common passive sensor is an infrared camera or an IR/UV (infrared/ultraviolet) system. The inherent weaknesses include the inability to discriminate oil on beaches, among seaweeds or debris. Among active sensors, the laser fluorosensor is a most useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, ice and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Disadvantages include the large size, weight and high cost. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches and foul weather remote sensing. Radar is costly, requires a dedicated aircraft, and is prone to many interferences. Equipment that measures relative slick thickness is still under development. Passive microwave has been studied for several years, but many commercial instruments lack sufficient spatial resolution to be practical, operational instruments. A laser-acoustic instrument, which provides the only technology to measure absolute oil thickness, is under development. Equipment operating in the visible region of the spectrum, such as cameras and scanners, is useful for documentation or providing a basis for the overlay of other data. It is not useful beyond this because oil shows no spectral characteristics in the visible region which can be used to discriminate oil.}

The first algorithm is based on the co-polar correlation coefficient, ??, and the scattering matrix decomposition parameters, Cloud entropy (H), mean scattering angle (??) and anisotropy (A). While each of these parameters has oil spill signature in it, we find that combining these parameters into a new parameter, F, is a more effective way for oil slick detection. The second algorithm uses the total power of four polarimetric channels image (SPAN) to find the optimal representation of the oil spill signature. Otsu image segmentation method can then be applied to the F and \{SPAN\} images to extract the oil slick features. Using the L-band fully polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle ??? synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) data acquired during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster event in the Gulf of Mexico, we are able to successfully extract the oil slick information in the contaminated ocean area. Our result shows that both algorithms perform well in identifying oil slicks in this case.}

Using the results from these measurements in conjunction with estimated sensor environmental noise thresholds, the theoretical minimum limit of detectability of each oil type (as a function of oil thickness) was calculated for both the hyperspectral \{HYMAP\} and multispectral Quickbird sensors. The Gippsland crude oil is discernable at layer thickness of 20????m or more in the Quickbird green channel. The \{HYMAP\} sensor was found to be theoretically capable of detecting a layer of Gippsland crude oil with a thickness of 10????m in approximately six sensor channels. By contrast, the North West Shelf light condensate was not able to be detected by either sensor for any thickness up to 200????m. Optical remote sensing is therefore not applicable for detecting diagnostic absorption features associated with this light condensate oil type, which is typical of the chemistry of many hydrocarbon oils found in the Australian Northwest Shelf area and condensates world wide. We conclude that oil type is critical to the applicability of optical remote sensing for natural oil slick detection and identification. We recommend that a sensor- and oil-specific sensitivity study should be conducted prior to applying optical remote sensors for oil exploration. The oil optical properties were obtained using two different laboratory methods, a reflectance-based approach and transmittance-based approach. The reflectance-based approach was relatively complex to implement, but was chosen in order to replicate as closely as possible real world remote sensing measurement conditions of an oil film on water. The transmittance-based approach, based upon standard laboratory spectrophotometric measurements was found to generate results in good agreement with the reflectance-based approach. Therefore, for future oil- and sensor-specific sensitivity studies, we recommend the relatively accessible transmittance-based approach, which is detailed in this paper.}

	abstract     = {Current operational approaches to ocean color remote sensing tend to be least accurate in coastal regions with waters rich in terrigenous material. Semi-analytical models can be used to retrieve the absorption and backscattering properties of dissolved and suspended materials unique to these environments, and subsequently biogeochemical parameters such as total suspended material (TSM) and chlorophyll (Chl). In this study, optical data collected over several years are used to select and optimize a semi-analytical ocean color algorithm for the dynamic and optically complex Long Island Sound estuary. The most successful algorithm requires a red reflectance channel between 600 and 650&#xa0;nm, which is not included in many current ocean color sensors, but is essential in highly scattering waters. Regional optimization including the use of a dynamic, spectrally variable f/Q, a value related to the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), results in an approximately five-fold decrease in retrieval bias in highly backscattering, sediment-laden waters near river outflows. Retrievals of dissolved and particulate spectral absorption, backscattering, dissolved and detrital absorption coefficients and total suspended matter obtained from the optimized algorithm agree well with field observations (r2&#xa0;???&#xa0;0.90). These parameters are useful for assessing riverine discharge, mixing and residence times of surface waters, as well as assessing the turbidity and light penetration in this estuary. Estimation of Chl remains challenging (r2&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.59) due to the stepwise nature of the algorithm and the relatively high proportion of dissolved and non-algal constituents masking phytoplankton absorption (generally&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;20\% of total absorption at 440&#xa0;nm). Moreover, diverse phytoplankton assemblages throughout the region create variability between spectral absorption and chlorophyll and highlight the benefits of increased spectral resolution of ocean color satellites going forward.}

Demands of the indoor environmental quality within the classroom generally vary with the education levels and result in ventilation energy consumption accounting for a considerable proportion of the total energy use in bulk educational buildings. Its huge energy-saving potential is attracting worldwide attention from scholars and governments. Therefore, appropriate operation strategies of ventilation systems should be adopted to effectively reduce energy consumption without sacrificing thermal comfort and IAQ. However, the absence of relevant standards and guidelines for designing a quality classroom environment considering the special features of educational buildings remains an important research question. This study conducts a comprehensive review to determine research gaps and identify future directions for the interaction between thermal comfort, IAQ and ventilation energy consumption for educational buildings. The review results show that: (1) The thermal comfort prediction model should consider the influences of genders, ages and socioeconomic backgrounds; (2) The mixed-mode ventilation coupling the natural and mechanical approaches is preferred given its advantage of lower energy consumption and improved thermal comfort, but its control strategies need further exploration; (3) Optimizing passive design parameters of buildings (e.g., window to wall ratios, window orientations and sun shading installations) can significantly reduce the ventilation demands while maintaining indoor thermal comfort; (4) More studies are required for investigating thermal comfort in educational buildings during the heating period; and (5) IAQ of university buildings clearly requires further studies, especially on bacterial and fungal aerosol pollutants, for a more comprehensive assessment of the built environment.},

	abstract     = {The cost of nosocomial infections in the United States is estimated to be \$4 billion to \$5 billion annually. Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design ,i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.},

The algorithm is based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the indoor air. The testing and validation has been done both for residential and non-residential buildings: two ofﬁces with mechanical ventilation system, one ofﬁce without mechanical ventilation, a kitchen and a big sleeping/living room of a residential building without mechanical ventilation have been evaluated. Volunteers recorded their presence proﬁles in the monitored rooms to permit the validation of the algorithms. The results of the algorithms for the detection of occupants (whether occupants are present or not) provides correct presence proﬁle up to 95.8\% of the time while the exact number of occupants in the rooms is correctly identiﬁed up to 80.6\% of the time.},

Only studies of quartz halogen lamps have suggested that users might sustain UVC-induced injury. Examination of light sources in the home and school of a child with xeroderma pigmentosum revealed that several different types emitted surprising levels of UV. Our purpose was to assess the extent of UV emissions from a variety of commonly used light sources to identify potential dermatological risks. UV and visible spectral emissions of commercially obtained lamps of several types were measured using a calibrated spectral radiometer traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Indoor light sources including fluorescent, quartz halogen and even tungsten filament incandescent lamps provided UVA, UVB and sometimes UVC emissions. Intensities of some emissions were of similar magnitude to those in sunlight. Chronic exposure to indoor lighting may deliver unexpected cumulative UV exposure to the skin and eyes. Patients with UV-exacerbated dermatoses should be cautioned about potential adverse reactions from indoor lighting.},

Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during the academic school year from spring 2021 through fall of 2022 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 air changes per hour (ACH) for prevention of aerosol transmission of COVID-19 in classrooms. Teachers reported noise generated by DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 μm (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5” MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averages 77\% after six months compared to 92\% for newly installed filters. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for \$200-\$650 with DIY versus \$600-\$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20\% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. The procedure using ambient aerosols to verify ACH from portable air cleaners and HVAC can be the basis for ACH certification or verification without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers) which may be unsafe or disallowed in schools.},

		Teachers will use “air purifiers” and are willing to accept minimal levels of increased noise. DIY Lennox MERV 16 filters offer cheap alternative but efficiency was observed to decrease with normal use from 92\% avg. in Feb ‘22 to 77\% avg. in Oct ‘22. “The experience at a California K-5 elementary school demonstrates the feasibility of daily operation in 16 classrooms, library, auditorium, lunchroom, and hallway. Teachers reported noise generated by DIY purifiers (made of box fans) to be tolerable / acceptable for daily classroom use when run on low speed.” (Srikrishna, 2022, p. 12) “As verified in one classroom of the school (Figure 8), tracking the indoor decay rate of ambient aerosol particles in the submicron range (0.3 μm) [19] can be used to validate the ACH of air purifiers (HEPA and DIY) separately from the ACH contribution from the HVAC system.” (Srikrishna, 2022, p. 13)

		“A high rate of particulate pollution measured outside at approximately 60,000 per liter was filtered down to approximately 25,000 per liter by the HVAC” (Srikrishna, 2022, p. 13) “During periods of extreme wildfire pollution, this measurement illustrates why enabling the HVAC can counteract the filtering effect of the portable air cleaners if the HVAC supplying “fresh” air ends up injecting high rates of carcinogenic wildfire particles into the classroom.” (Srikrishna, 2022, p. 13)

	abstract     = {HVAC ﬁlters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality consequences of high efﬁciency ﬁlters installed in commercial buildings. To explore these effects, system airﬂow, ﬁlter and coil pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four ﬁlter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were estimated for a large dataset of ﬁlters divided into four efﬁciency (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan speed control showed that increased ﬁlter pressure drop decreased ﬂow, cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy consumption (2e4\%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy savings during fan-only mode (8e13\%) in units without fan speed control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11e18\%) in the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5 (2.9e3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger beneﬁts achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of ﬁltration is essential to selecting the appropriate efﬁciency of ﬁlters that ensures low-energy use and a healthy indoor environment.},

Ventilation strategies included the protocols issued by the Public Administration, while others were developed based on the typological configuration and use of the school. Results revealed that it is advisable to implement certain strategies that reduce the risk of infection among the occupants of the spaces, without a significant decrease in hygrothermal comfort. Given the importance of maintaining better IAQ in the future within classrooms, and regarding the pre-COVID situation, these strategies may be extended beyond this pandemic period, through a simple protocol and necessary didactic package to be assumed by both teachers and students of the centre.},

However, since the indoor PM concentration varies depending on the humidiﬁcation method and water type used, relevant studies are needed. Accordingly, this study examined the change in the PM2.5 concentration and relative humidity on the basis of water types and humidiﬁcation method. It was found that the indoor PM2.5 concentration varied from 16 to 350 ug/m3, depending on the water types used for an ultrasonic humidiﬁer. Conversely, when using a natural evaporative humidiﬁer, white dust did not increase the indoor PM2.5 concentration, regardless of the mineral content of the water used. Considering both humidiﬁcation ability and continuous humidiﬁer use indoors, water puriﬁer with nano-trap ﬁlters must be utilized for ultrasonic humidiﬁers.},

These include escalation of energy costs, heightened awareness about acceptable IAQ, aging of the commercial building inventory, numerous revisions and addenda to ventilation standards and building codes, and green building/sustainability initiatives and energy tax credits. A field study was performed on established installations of particulate and gas-phase filtration in and around Atlanta, Georgia (USA) and included a variety of building types and usage and evaluated environmental conditions and airborne contaminants. The study was undertaken in two parts with Phase I being to establish and finalize test and measurement protocols and a Phase II field investigation. This paper provides a summary of both Phases, including characteristics of untreated outdoor air, and air cleaning with particulate filters and gas-phase air filtration. Overall, there was a TVOC reduction of 38-74\%, 0.5 µm particulate removal efficiency of 28-95\%, and an ozone removal efficiency of 100\%. Each building had annual operational cost savings ranging between US\$10,000 and US\$800,000. The field study is intended to establish the parameters of dilution air compared with similar characteristics of air treated with particulate and gas-phase filtration. The field study demonstrated that filtered air can meet or exceed the IAQ level from simple dilution with outdoor air. The study also documents the comparable energy savings as a result of a reduction in outdoor air ventilation rates and significant control of specific contaminants of concern regarding occupant safety and building security.},

Past simulation studies have shown that commercial building envelope leakage can result in significant heating and cooling loads. To evaluate the potential energy savings of an effective air barrier requirement, annual energy simulations were prepared for three nonresidential buildings (a two-story office building, a one-story retail building, and a four-story apartment building) in 5 U.S. cities. A coupled multizone airflow and building energy simulation tool was used to predict the energy use for the buildings at a target tightness level relative to a baseline level based on measurements in existing buildings. Based on assumed blended national average heating and cooling energy prices, predicted potential annual heating and cooling energy cost savings ranged from 3 \% to 36 \% with the smallest savings occurring in the cooling-dominated climates of Phoenix and Miami. In order to put these estimated energy savings in context, a cost effectiveness calculation was performed using the scalar ratio methodology employed by ASHRAE SSPC 90.1.},

Although near-field transmission and infectious spread within individual rooms are well studied, the impact of aerosolized spread of SARS-CoV-2 via air handling systems within multiroom buildings remains unexplored. This study evaluates the concentra­ tions and probabilities of infection for both building interior and exterior exposure sources using a well-mixed model in a multiroom building served by a central air handling system (without packaged terminal air condi­ tioning). In particular, we compare the influence of filtration, air change rates, and the fraction of outdoor air. When the air supplied to the rooms comprises both outdoor air and recirculated air, we find filtration lowers the concentration and probability of infection the most in connected rooms. We find that increasing the air change rate removes virus from the source room faster but also increases the rate of exposure in connected rooms. Therefore, slower air change rates reduce infectivity in connected rooms at shorter durations. We further find that increasing the fraction of virus-free outdoor air is helpful, unless outdoor air is infective in which case pathogen exposure inside persists for hours after a short-term release. Increasing the outdoor air to 33\% or the filter to MERV-13 decreases the infectivity in the connected rooms by 19\% or 93\% respectively, relative to a MERV-8 filter with 9\% outdoor air based on 100 quanta/h of 5 μm droplets, a breathing rate of 0.48 m3/h, and the building dimensions and air handling system considered.},

		“Most of the docu mented spread of the disease has occurred within buildings, and a majority of the “superspreader” events where multiple individuals have been infected occurred at least partially in buildings [” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 1)

		“These findings, coupled with mounting evidence of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 [5,6], raise serious questions about the extent to which the virus may spread to connected rooms through HVAC systems” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 1) “In general, models of aerosolized pathogen spread throughout buildings divide into those that account for local concentration gradients, typically using computational fluid dynamics codes (e.g., Ref. [9] for recirculation flows within elevators, classrooms, and supermarkets using a single room formulation inclusive of obstacles), and those that neglect concentration gradients and use well-mixed models [10]. Thus far, most models of virus spread generally, and SARS-CoV-2 specifically, use well-mixed models. For example, Yang and Marr [11] predicted the evolving size distribution as a function of time for influenza A viruses in a well-mixed room to find that increased air change rates reduce the concentration of the virus within a well-mixed space faster.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 2)

		“In summary, we evaluated concentrations and probabilities of infection for both internal and external exposure sources using a wellmixed model in a building with a central HVAC system. The presented results indicate meaningful exposure via the ventilation system in support of our hypothesis.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 11) “Increasing the air changerate should also be consideredwith caution because it may increase the rate of viral aerosol spread via HVAC systems. In our study, when the ACH is increased from 1.8 to 12, the time to the peak concentration of virus in the connected rooms decreases from 30 min to 11 min.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 11)

The student population is 62,000 with growth of 2,000 students each year - 100 new classrooms. Under this type of growth, the school district sought ways to accommodate additional students, deal with moisture and humidity, provide acceptable air quality, and limit energy consumption. In 2003, the school district used air cleaning and the IAQ Procedure of ASHRAE Standard 62.1 as part of a plan to address these issues. Four elementary schools previously housed a total of 106 portable classrooms. School additions replaced these classrooms with permanent buildings using the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure to design the HVAC outdoor air requirements. These designs reduced outdoor air requirements from a total of 41,856 cfm to 14,375 cfm, a difference of 27,480 cfm. They also evaluated air quality by modeling acetone, ammonia, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, methyl alcohol, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phenol, sulfur dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds.

Positive results included the reduction of many contaminant concentrations, lower inhaler usage, and operational savings.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 1)

		“The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) first published their ventilation standard in 1973. The original version prescribed minimum ventilation air quantities in terms of volumetric flow rates per person (ASHRAE 1981). In 1981, the standard added the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure as a performance based approach for determining minimum ventilation rates. The standard called the original method of using prescribed ventilation rates the Ventilation Rate Procedure.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 1)

		“According to the 62.1 Users Manual, engineers have used the Ventilation Rate Procedure more often than the IAQ Procedure and NEISD was the same before 2003.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 2) “overall per person ventilation rates of 15 – 20 cfm per person. Outdoor air amounts for the IAQ Procedure were 4 – 14\% of supply. Dividing these outdoor air amounts by the total occupancies yields overall per person ventilation rates of 5 – 7 cfm per person.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 3) “The average reduction in outdoor air amounts for these schools was close to 70\%.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 3)

		paradox: pulling less outdoor air is more efficient. Pulling less air through filtration reduces efficacy “First, the effectiveness of gas-phase filtration depends on the amount of air the filters contact. When the primary air flow decreases, the contaminant concentration increases; the filtration system removes less of the contaminant because it is cleaning less air.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 5) “Designs using the IAQ Procedure and gas-phase filtration must keep minimum primary flows above certain limits to provide contact time with the filters.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		“Third, internal sources with higher emission rates may prevent the use of re-circulated air with typical gas-phase and particulate filtration. These sources require local exhausts or stronger gasphase and particulate filtration equipment. Some examples of internal sources with higher emission rates may include art classrooms, janitor’s closets, kitchen areas, science laboratories, and woodwork shops.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		“For many buildings, the IAQ Procedure is an option that provides direct control of indoor air contaminants not possible under the Ventilation Rate Procedure. This provides improved indoor air quality as well as reducing the amount of energy spent on conditioning the ambient air. This makes it a powerful tool for building owners and engineers to employ.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		Achieving “engineering predicted” results is unlikely given the many variables involved in optimizing building design for filtration/ventilation. This is a (hidden) cost beyond a simple retrofit. “On the mechanical side, there are several factors that must be known in order to perform IAQ and energy savings calculations and these include the amounts of outside and recirculation air, ventilation efficiency, and filter location. On the contaminant side, there are factors pertaining to geographic location, building use, air cleaner efficiencies and removal capacities.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) “Different geographic locations will require the use of several different sets of data (weather data, utility costs, etc.) that can affect the operation and performance of the HVAC system.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) Note that increased ventilation as a strategy raises massive equity issues for low income / minority neighborhoods where AQ tends to be poorer. “The most common applications, and those with the greatest potential for capital cost savings and operational cost reductions, involve new construction and renovation.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) And that is the key issue… to implement gas phase + particulate filtration requires significant renovation. “The IAQ Procedure is often neglected as a method for complying with the ventilation requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 11)

However, these exposure beneﬁts also caused an increase in energy consumption, and the magnitude depends on the city's climate, outdoor PM2.5 concentration and the retail store type.

For cities with high outdoor PM2.5 concentration, adopting the VRP with high PM2.5 efficiency for all store types yielded the greatest exposure benefits.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 186) “However, these exposure benefits also caused an increase in energy consumption, and the magnitude depends on the city's climate, outdoor PM2.5 concentration and the retail store type.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 186) “just considering the retail sector, eliminating ventilation would decrease the total energy use index (i.e., building's energy use as a function of its size) by 8.4\% on average, with the gas energy use index decreasing by 27.8\% [8].” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 186)

		“a review of ventilation measurements in retail stores found that half of the stores tested met or exceeded the VRP; nonetheless, these ventilation rates were not sufficient to keep all pollutants below their most conservative limits [11]. Specifically, there is no documentation of the adequacy of VRP in maintaining an acceptable indoor air quality in retail buildings.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“Five of these studies found that DCV was not sufficient to control the measured pollutants below their established limits. DCV-based CO2 does not generally control outdoor-generated pollutants, nor does it account for pollutants generated indoors but independently of human activities.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“In the objective assessment, the IAQP requires designers to select the ventilation rate that will keep each individual COC below its established limit. This ignores the fact that some pollutants (e.g. ozone, and some particles) can be generated outdoors, and keeping the ventilation rate to a minimum may be more advantageous from both exposure and energy perspectives.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“What is the optimal ventilationefiltration combination strategy that will lead to a balance between exposure to pollutants and energy consumption?” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187) “The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric was chosen as the common metric of exposure to compare exposures to contaminants of concern for different control strategies, as an alternative to relying on the widely varying published health standards or guidelines. The main strength of the DALY metric is that it combines the fatal and non-fatal health outcomes into a single value (i.e. years of life lost due to death and disability) [25]. This metric is commonly used and is endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO).” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 188)

		“For a typical 10,000 m2 store, the magnitude of energy cost to achieve the maximum exposure benefits depended on the city and the retail type, ranging from \$1000 in annual cost for filtration energy in a grocery store in Los Angeles to \$24,000 as the annual cost of ventilation in a grocery store in Austin.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 195)

At the same time, the operating costs of HVAC systems are often a large percentage of the total energy consumption of buildings, which constitutes 40\% of the primary energy consumed in the U.S. As efforts are pursued to reduce building energy use, which may involve reductions in outdoor air ventilation rates, it is important to consider the impacts of these measures on IAQ. To better understand the IAQ and energy trade-offs of various ventilation approaches, simulations were performed using the multizone airﬂow model, CONTAM, for a big box retail store in two climates. Annual energy simulations were also performed in EnergyPlus. Simulations included ventilating at the minimum outdoor airﬂow rate prescribed by the ASHRAE Standard 62.1e2013 Ventilation Rate Procedure during occupied hours and at a lower rate for 24 h a day. Additional cases included increasing the base outdoor air intake rates and changing the building envelope airtightness. Annual airﬂow and contaminant (carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, ozone, particulate matter, and a generic volatile organic compound) simulations were performed using emission rates from previous studies of retail buildings. This study demonstrated that ventilating at a lower rate for 24 h a day saved energy compared with ventilating at the higher rate prescribed in ASHRAE 62.1 and that the simulated indoor contaminant concentrations did not exceed common benchmarks or health guidelines.},

	abstract     = {Building ventilation has long been recognized for its role in occupant health, comfort and productivity, with some of the ﬁrst recommendations on building ventilation rates published in the 19th century. These recommendations were subsequently transformed into more rigorous standards and guidance in the 20th century, with the ﬁrst version of ASHRAE Standard 62 published in 1973. Since that time, ventilation standards have been issued in several countries around the world and have dealt with an increasingly complex and challenging range of issues as research on indoor air quality and the state of knowledge of building performance have progressed. This paper reviews and discusses some of the issues that have been addressed in the development of ventilation standards in recent years, using the development of ASHRAE Standard 62 as context, including: the scientiﬁc bases for ventilation requirements, perceived indoor air quality, contaminant sources from occupants and the building, outdoor air quality, airborne contaminant limits, indoor carbon dioxide concentrations, environmental tobacco smoke, and performance-based design. Issues that are expected to be dealt with as Standard 62 and other standards are developed into the future are also reviewed.},

		“New York State Ventilation Commission was formed in 1913 to study ventilation requirements in schools and other public buildings. Their report stated that the 15 L/s per person requirement was not justified and that 5 L/s to 7.5 L/s per person was adequate for classrooms.” (Persily, 2015, p. 62) “1946 when the American Standards Association issued a standard that required lighting and ventilation in all habitable rooms through the use of windows” (Persily, 2015, p. 62)

		“Those rates were 2.5 L/s m2 in offices and 7.6 L/ sm2 in public buildings including schools, which translate to 50 L/s per person in offices and 22 L/s in classrooms based on the default occupancy densities” (Persily, 2015, p. 62)

		“ASHRAE Standard 62, and its subsequent incarnations as Standard 62.1 (covering commercial, institutional and high-rise residential) and Standard 62.2 (low-rise residential), has served as one of the most prominent ventilation standards since it was first published in 1973” (Persily, 2015, p. 62) “Ventilation rate requirements for different space types have been revisited in subsequent versions of Standard 62 since it was originally published in 1973, as well as in other standards.” (Persily, 2015, p. 63)

		“In 2004, Standard 62 was split into two standards, 62.1 covering commercial, institutional and high-rise residential buildings and 62.2 covering low-rise residential.” (Persily, 2015, p. 63) “It is well recognized that for ventilation to have a positive impact on IAQ, the air brought into the building must be relatively free of contaminants generated indoors as well as key outdoor air contaminants.” (Persily, 2015, p. 65)

		“The committee discussed other outdoor contaminants that are commonly at high concentrations, such as CO, but the lack of either practical air cleaning equipment or rating methods resulted in those contaminants not being addressed.” (Persily, 2015, p. 65)

		“ASHRAE Standard 62-1981 also introduced the Indoor Air Quality Procedure, the alternative, performance-based design approach, which is discussed below.” (Persily, 2015, p. 66)

		“Both the U.S. Green Building Council LEED rating system [33]and ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1 [46], Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings, include contaminant limits as an alternative to conducting a building flush out after construction but before occupancy.” (Persily, 2015, p. 66) “The CDPH document is a standard for testing and evaluating VOC emissions from building materials in chambers and contains a list of maximum allowable concentrations for target VOCs that are equal to one-half of the Chronic Reference Exposure Levels (CRELs) issued by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). As stated in CDPH v1.1, these “CRELs are inhalation concentrations to which the general population, including sensitive individuals, may be exposed for long periods (10 years or more) without the likelihood of serious adverse systemic effects (excluding cancer).”” (Persily, 2015, p. 66)

Human VOC emissions indoors from exercise are still relatively uncertain, and questions remain about emissions from chlorinebased cleaners. To investigate these and other issues, the ATHLETic center study of Indoor Chemistry (ATHLETIC) campaign was conducted in the weight room of the Dal Ward Athletic Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. Using a Vocus Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (Vocus PTR-TOF), an Aerodyne Gas Chromatograph (GC), an Iodide-Chemical Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (I-CIMS), and Picarro cavity ringdown spectrometers, we alternated measurements between the weight room and supply air, allowing for determination of VOC, NH3, H2O, and CO2 emission rates per person (emission factors). Human-derived emission factors were higher than previous studies of measuring indoor air quality in rooms with individuals at rest and correlated with increased CO2 emission factors. Emission factors from personal care products (PCPs) were consistent with previous studies and typically decreased throughout the day. In addition, N-chloraldimines were observed in the gas phase after the exercise equipment was cleaned with a dichlor solution. The chloraldimines likely originated from reactions of free amino acids with HOCl on gym surfaces.},

For example, after being exhausted from buildings, these VOCs can account for over 50\% of the OH reactivity and SOA production observed in ambient air in Los Angeles.3” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324) “Humans also act as a significant source of VOCs in indoor environments due to breathing,4,5 sweating, and skin emanations.6,7” “In addition, these studies used a quadrupole PTR-MS or selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS), limiting the scope of each study to a few VOCs in order to improve time resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324)

		“Hypochlorite bleach is used to disinfect surfaces in homes, offices, pools, and gyms, possibly leading to respiratory ailments for those who work in the cleaning industry” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324)

While some commercial electronic air cleaners can be effective in reducing primary pollutants and inactivating bioaerosol, studies on the formation of secondary products from oxidation chemistry during their use are limited. Here, we measured oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and the chemical composition of particles generated from a hydroxyl radical generator in an office. During operation, enhancements in OVOCs, especially low-molecular-weight organic acids, were detected. Rapid increases in particle number and mass concentrations were observed, corresponding to the formation of highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (O:C ∼1.3), with an enhanced signal at m/z 44 (CO2+) in the organic mass spectra. These results suggest that organic acids generated during VOC oxidation contributed to particle nucleation and SOA formation. Nitrate, sulfate, and chloride also increased during the oxidation without a corresponding increase in ammonium, suggesting organic nitrate, organic sulfate, and organic chloride formation. As secondary species are reported to have detrimental health effects, further studies should not be limited to the inactivation of bioaerosol or reduction of particular VOCs, but should also evaluate potential OVOCs and SOA formation from electronic air cleaners in different indoor environments.},

Here, we examine the influence of several oxidation-based air cleaners, specifically ones marketed as consumer-grade products, on the amounts and composition of VOCs. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber, with a suite of real-time analytical instruments to measure direct emissions, VOC removal efficacies (by the addition of either limonene and toluene), and byproduct formation. We find that the air cleaners themselves can be a source of organic gases, that removal efficacy can be exceedingly variable, and that VOC loss is primarily driven by physical removal in some cleaners. When oxidative degradation of VOCs was observed, it was accompanied by the formation of a range of oxidation byproducts, including formaldehyde and other oxygenates. These results indicate that some consumer-grade portable air cleaners can be ineffective in removing VOCs and that the air delivered may contain a range of organic compounds, due to direct emission and/or byproduct formation.},

Airborne particulates are of particular significance for their human health impacts and their roles in both atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry. Observations of airborne particulates are typically made by environmental agencies using rather expensive instruments. Due to the expense of the instruments usually used by environment agencies, the number of sensors that can be deployed is limited. In this study we show that machine learning can be used to effectively calibrate lower cost optical particle counters. For this calibration it is critical that measurements of the atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature are also made.},

The PM2.5 data products are available, on a daily basis, from August 1997 to the present, with 10 km resolutions and global coverage. In this study, a sub-set of the PM2.5 retrievals (collected over the southern African Interior) has been averaged over ten-day intervals for a period of ten years. These averaged sub-sets have been clustered using self-organizing maps to generate spatial and seasonal "PM2.5 climates" and air quality interpretations over southern Africa. Results are an indirect validation of the satellite based data product against available regional ground-based and airborne studies. The final PM2.5 aerosol climatology shows that the data product provides credible PM2.5 estimates for a region that is lacking routine aerosol monitoring data.},

	abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) radiative-dynamical-chemical model has been developed and used to study the evolution of trace gases in the Arctic lower stratosphere during winter 1989-1990. A series of 10-day model integrations were performed throughout this period. The model includes a comprehensive scheme of gas phase chemical reactions as well as a parameterization of heterogeneous reactions occurring on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) surfaces. An important element of a 3D chemical model is the transport scheme. In this study the transport of chemical species is achieved by a non diffusive method well suited to the preservation of sharp gradients. During the winter studied temperatures were cold enough for the formation of both type I and type II polar stratospheric clouds from early December to early February. Model simulations in late December show that inside the polar vortex air is rapidly processed by polar stratospheric clouds converting HCl and ClONO2 to active chlorine. The possibility of ozone destruction depends strongly on the amount of sunlight. In early February an average ozone loss of 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) /day is predicted in PSC-processed air at 50 hPa. giving a column loss of just under 1 DU/day. This loss increases to 25 ppbv/day if PSCs persist until March with a column loss of around 1.5 DU/day. The relatively small magnitude of the ozone loss predicted in the model, compared to the variability of ozone induced by dynamics, highlights the problems in identifying the signature of chemical ozone loss in the Arctic. In future years significant ozone depletion could occur if PSCs persist until late March. rhe efficiency of the catalytic cycles responsible for the ozone loss has been analyzed as a function of latitude, altitude and time. In general, the cycle involving ClO + ClO is the dominant loss mechanism in the polar lower stratosphere. Cycles involving BrO can make a relatively large contribution early in the season and when the levels of CIO are low. The cycle initiated by ClO + O destroys ozone at altitudes above 30 hPa but the loss is compensated, to some extent, by in situ ozone production. The results for trace species are validated, where possible, by comparison with the available measurements, although the sparse nature of the observations does not effectively constrain the model.},

The neural network performs well even in regions where the correlations are less compact and normally a family of correlation curves would be required. For example, the CH4-N2(O) correlation can be well described using a neural network trained with the latitude, pressure, time of year, and CH4 volume mixing ratio (v.m.r.). In this study a neural network using Quickprop learning and one hidden layer with eight nodes was able to reproduce the CH4-N2O correlation with a correlation coefficient between simulated and training values of 0.9995. Such an accurate representation of tracer-tracer correlations allows more use to be made of long-term datasets to constrain chemical models. Such as the dataset from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) which has continuously observed CH4 (but not N2O) from 1991 till the present. The neural network Fortran code used is available for download.}

	abstract     = {This paper highlights the importance of halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The calculated rate of methane oxidation is increased by at least 20% in the upper troposphere when halogen catalysis is included. In the lower stratosphere, approximately 25% of methane oxidation can be initiated by chlorine; the precise fraction is very temperature dependent. Including halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation increases the HOx and ClOx concentrations and decreases the NOx concentration. The calculated enhancement in the HOx concentration due to halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is around 10-15% in the lower stratosphere; and around 20% in the upper troposphere. The decrease in the NOx concentration is around 10% in the upper troposphere. The enhancement in the ClOx concentration is around 7-10% in the lower stratosphere. The increase in the calculated HOx and ClOx concentrations and the decrease in the NOx concentration lead to a enhancement in the calculated O-3 loss. The additional O-3 loss calculated is most significant in the upper troposphere where over a 7-day simulation it was of the order of 0.1-1% for midlatitudes at equinox. As the atmospheric loading of chlorine drops the gross odd-oxygen production by NO + HO2 will increase, so there will be an accelerated ozone recovery. On a per molecule basis, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than chlorine catalyzed methane oxidation. In the upper troposphere bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation destroys ozone at a rate which is approximately one: third of that at which nitrogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is producing ozone. Therefore, with the increasing atmospheric bromine loading, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is set to become more important. It would be valuable to have kinetic studies of the reaction BrO with CH3O2 so that the role of bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation can be quantified more precisely.},

Location of the measurements was close to the terminator and near the edge of the polar vortex, which is highly distorted from concentric flow by strong planetary wave activities. These conditions necessitate accurate calculation, properly taking into account the transport and photochemical processes, in order to quantitatively explain the observed NO profile. A three-dimensional chemistry and transport model (CTM) and a trajectory model (TM) were used to interpret the profile observations within their larger spatial, temporal, and chemical context. The NO profile calculated by the CTM is in good agreement with that observed on January 31, 1992. In addition, model NOy profiles show small variabilities depending on latitudes, and they change little between January 22 and 31. The TM uses the observed NOy values. The NO values calculated by the CTM and TM agree with observations up to 27 km. Between 20 and 27 km the NO values calculated by the trajectory model including only gas phase chemistry are much larger than those including heterogeneous chemistry, indicating that NO mixing ratios were reduced significantly by heterogeneous chemistry on sulfuric acid aerosols. Very little sunlight to generate NOx from HNO3 was available, also causing the very low NO values. The good agreement between the observed and modeled NO profiles indicates that models can reproduce the photochemical and transport processes in the region where NO values have a sharp horizontal gradient. Moreover, CTM and TM model results show that even when the NOy gradients are weak, the model NO depends upon accurate calculation of the transport and insolation for several days.},

A key consideration in the design of new instruments is the spatial resolution required to effectively monitor air quality from space. In this paper, variograms have been used to address this issue by calculating the horizontal length scales of ozone within the boundary layer and free troposphere using both in situ aircraft data from five different NASA aircraft campaigns and simulations with an air-quality model. For both the observations and the model, the smallest scale features were found in the boundary layer, with a characteristic scale of about 50 km which increased to greater than 150 km above the boundary layer. The length scale changes with altitude. It is shown that similar length scales are derived based on a totally independent approach using constituent lifetimes and typical wind speeds. To date, the spaceborne observations of tropospheric constituents have been from several instruments including TOMS, GOME, MOPITT, TES, and OMI which, in general, have different weighting functions that need to be considered, and none really measures at the surface. A further complication is that most satellite measurements (such as those of OMI and GOME) are of the vertically integrated column. In this paper, the length scales in the column measurements were also of the order of 50 km. To adequately resolve the 50-km features, a horizontal resolution of at least 10 km would be desirable.},

Carbonyl compounds are the crucial intermediate species for the autocatalytic production of OH. For example, in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere it is calculated based on data assimilation analysis of Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy Experiment (ATTMOS) data that CH3 production due to the degradation of carbonyls contributes around 40% to the overall production of CH3, a key initiation step for HOx production, with the contribution due to the photolysis of CH3CHO being comparable to that of acetone. So correctly modeling the alkyl radical concentrations is of central importance and has not be given the attention it deserves to date. The reactions of carbonyls with Br and Cl are also major sources of HBr and HCl. In short, carbonyl compounds play a central role in atmospheric chemistry close to the tropopause, and this is directly relevant to issues such as the assessment of the impact of air traffic, and ozone depletion.},

The goal of the chemistry data assimilation is to combine an atmospheric-chemistry model and actual observations to produce the best estimate of the chemistry of the atmosphere. The observational dataset collected during the past decades is an unprecedented expansion of our knowledge of the atmosphere. The exploitation of these data is the best way to advance our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, and to develop chemistry models for chemistry-climate prediction. The assimilation focuses on estimating the state of the chemistry in a chemically and dynamically consistent manner (if the model allows online interactions between chemistry and dynamics). In so doing, we can: produce simultaneous and chemically consistent estimates of all species (including model parameters), observed and unobserved; fill in data voids; test the photochemical theories used in the chemistry models. In this paper, the Hilbert space is first formulated from the geometric structure of the Banach space, followed by the development of the adjoint operator in Hilbert space. The principle of the adjoint method is described, followed by two examples which show the relationship of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the Output vector and the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input vector. Applications to chemistry data assimilation are presented for both continuous and discrete cases. The 4D data variational adjoint method is then tested in the assimilation of stratospheric chemistry using a simple catalytic ozone-destruction mechanism, and the test results indicate that the performance of the assimilation method is good.},

For CO, the annual variations in the BDC amplify the annual fluctuations in CO at the tropopause as has recently been shown by Randel et al (2007). In both cases, the tropopause signal is carried upward by the mean BDC. For ozone, N2O, HCl and other gases, photochemical processes force fluctuations in the trace gases to be synchronized with annual and QBO variations in the zonal mean residual vertical velocity as is shown using lag correlations.},

This study used a remote-controlled aerial vehicle to look at the horizontal, vertical, and temporal variability of airborne particulates within the first 150 m of the atmosphere. Four flights were conducted on December 4, 2014, between 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm local time. The first three flights flew a pattern of increasing altitude up to 140 m. The fourth flight was conducted at a near-constant altitude of 60 m. The mean PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration for the three flights with varying altitude was 36.3 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup>, with the highest concentration occurring below 10 m altitude. The overall vertical variation was very small with a standard deviation of only 3.6 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup>.

A major advantage of this approach is that large statistical samples are used that do not require correlative measurements to be co-located in space and time. Examples are shown from the launch of UARS through to the present. This approach is also useful to evaluate the consistency among Aura instruments as well as their agreement with other datasets. A key feature of this work is putting the observations of Aura in their long-term historical context via statistical comparisons with previous datasets collected over more than a decade. To validate the Aura data, we use data from a variety of platforms including solar occultation (Canadian ACE) and limb sounder satellite instruments, ozonesondes (WOUDC), lidar (NDSC), and aircraft instruments (AVE, PAVE, and MOZAIC). The width of the trace gas PDFs can be used to accurately estimate the atmospheric spatial variability (or representativeness uncertainty) of trace gases as a function of time and location. This statistical analysis is also being used as preparation for full Kalman filter chemical assimilations. The analysis is presented online at http://ww-tv.PDFCentral.info.},

There was no significant difference in the overall prevalence of cataract between the two villages, The male population in each village was subdivided into those who worked predominantly indoors and those who worked predominantly outdoors, All women worked outdoors, There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male outdoor workers in the two villages, The indoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza) had a significantly higher cataract prevalence (p<0.001) than the indoor workers in the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol), In the village with lower UV light exposure (Nomol), the male outdoor workers had a significantly higher prevalence of cataract than the male indoor workers (p<0.001), There was no significant difference in the prevalence of cataract between the male indoor and outdoor workers in the village with higher UV light exposure (Hunza), Overall, these results are not strongly supportive of UV light being of major importance in cataractogenesis, but they are consistent with a saturation model of UV light as a risk factor for cataract formation.}

The open-path, laser-based sensor provides fast (10 Hz) and precise (0.1 ppmv) measurements of methane in a compact package while the remote control aircraft provides nimble and safe operation around a local source. Emission rates were measured from 22 flights over a one-week period. Mean emission rates of 14 ± 8 g CH4 s-1 (7.4 ± 4.2 g CH4 s-1 median) from the station were observed or approximately 0.02% of the station throughput. Significant variability in emission rates (0.3-73 g CH4 s-1 range) was observed on time scales of hours to days, and plumes showed high spatial variability in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Given the high spatiotemporal variability of emissions, individual measurements taken over short durations and from ground-based platforms should be used with caution when examining compressor station emissions. More generally, our results demonstrate the unique advantages and challenges of platforms like small unmanned aerial vehicles for quantifying local emission sources to the atmosphere.}

Reduction of HNO3, NO2, and O-3 on carbon aerosols may be an important effect of increased air traffic that has not been considered to date. It is shown that if HNO3, NO2 and O-3 are heterogeneously reduced on atmospheric amorphous carbon aerosols, then a significant, lower stratospheric ozone loss mechanism could exist. This ozone loss mechanism is almost independent of temperature and does not require the presence of sunlight. The mechanism can operate at all latitudes where amorphous carbon aerosols are present. The relative importance of the mechanism increases with nightlength. The reduction of HNO3 on carbon aerosols could also be a significant renoxification process wherever carbon aerosols are present. Owing to the very different soot levels in the two hemispheres, this implies that there should be a hemispheric assymetry in the role of these mechanisms. The renoxification leads to simulated tropospheric HNO3/NOx ratios that are close to those Observed. In contrast ta the stratospheric response, the tropospheric production of NOx due to the reduction of HNO3 would lead to tropospheric ozone production.},

The study is aided by data from a 6-week parameterized-chemistry run of the Goddard Space Flight Center 3D Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM), initialized on 8 December 1991. Generally, CO mixing ratios increase with height due to the increasing source contribution from CO2 photolysis. In the tropical upper stratosphere, however, a local maximum in CO mixing ratio occurs. A simple photochemical model is used to show that this feature results largely from methane oxidation. In the extratropics the photochemical lifetime of CO is long, and therefore its evolution is dictated by large scale motion of air, evidenced by strong correlation with Ertel potential vorticity. This makes CO one of the few useful observable tracers at the stratopause level and above. Thus CO maps are used to study the synoptic evolution of the polar vortex in early January 1992. Modified Lagrangian mean mixing diagnostics are applied to ISAMS and CTM data to examine the strength of the mixing barrier at the polar vortex edge. It is demonstrated that planetary wave activity weakens the barrier, promoting vortex erosion. The vortex erosion first appears in the lower mesosphere and subsequently descends through the upper stratosphere, and is attributed to effects of planetary wave dissipation. Agreement between ISAMS and CTM is good in the horizontal distribution of CO throughout the examined period, but vertical CO gradients in the CTM weaken with time relative to the ISAMS observations.},

Of these two clade 4 species, Pmeg is more virulent and is displacing Ppal in many cacao production areas in Africa. Symptoms and species specific sporangia production were compared when the two species were co-inoculated onto pod pieces in staggered 24 h time intervals. Pmeg sporangia were predominantly recovered from pod pieces with unwounded surfaces even when inoculated 24 h after Ppal. On wounded surfaces, sporangia of Ppal were predominantly recovered if the two species were simultaneously applied or Ppal was applied first but not if Pmeg was applied first. Pmeg demonstrated an advantage over Ppal when infecting un-wounded surfaces while Ppal had the advantage when infecting wounded surfaces. RNA-Seq was carried out on RNA isolated from control and Pmeg and Ppal infected pod pieces 3 days post inoculation to assess their abilities to alter/suppress cacao defense. Expression of 4,482 and 5,264 cacao genes was altered after Pmeg and Ppal infection, respectively, with most genes responding to both species. Neural network self-organizing map analyses separated the cacao RNA-Seq gene expression profiles into 24 classes, 6 of which were largely induced in response to infection. Using KEGG analysis, subsets of genes composing interrelated pathways leading to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis and action, plant defense signal transduction, and endocytosis showed induction in response to infection. A large subset of genes encoding putative Pr-proteins also showed differential expression in response to infection. A subset of 36 cacao genes was used to validate the RNA-Seq expression data and compare infection induced gene expression patterns in leaves and wounded and unwounded pod husks. Expression patterns between RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR were generally reproducible. The level and timing of altered gene expression was influenced by the tissues studied and by wounding. Although, in these susceptible interactions gene expression patterns were similar, some genes did show differential expression in a Phytophthora species dependent manner. The biggest difference was the more intense changes in expression in Ppal inoculated wounded pod pieces further demonstrating its rapid progression when penetrating through wounds.},

	abstract     = {The long term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) record provides a critical historical perspective on vegetation dynamics necessary for global change research. Despite the proliferation of new sources of global, moderate resolution vegetation datasets, the remote sensing community is still struggling to create datasets derived from multiple sensors that allow the simultaneous use of spectral vegetation for time series analysis. To overcome the non-stationary aspect of NDVI, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to map the NDVI indices from AVHRR to those from MODIS using atmospheric, surface type and sensor-specific inputs to account for the differences between the sensors. The NDVI dynamics and range of MODIS NDVI data at 1 is matched and extended through the AVHRR record. Four years of overlap between the two sensors is used to train a neural network to remove atmospheric and sensor specific effects on the AVHRR NDVI. In this paper, we present the resulting continuous dataset, its relationship to MODIS data, and a validation of the product.},

	abstract     = {We describe a new and computationally efficient technique for global three-dimensional modeling of stratospheric chemistry. This technique involves integrating a photochemical package along a large number of independent trajectories to produce a Lagrangian view of the atmosphere. Although Lagrangian chemical modeling with trajectories is an established procedure, this extension of integrating chemistry along a large number of domain-filling trajectories is a novel technique. This technique is complementary to three-dimensional Eulerian chemical transport modeling and avoids spurious mixing caused by low resolutions or diffusive transport schemes in these models. We illustrate the technique by studying the chlorine activation in the Arctic winter lower stratosphere. A photochemical model was integrated along large ensembles of calculated trajectories between 20 and 100 mbar for the 1991/1992 winter in order to produce a three-dimensional chemical picture. Large amounts of chlorine was activated at low altitudes (80 to 100 mbar) as well as altitudes near 50 mbar. This activated air was well contained at all levels, with little indication of mixing into lower latitudes. Model results for early January 1992 were compared to daily Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) ClO observations at 465 K. The structure and evolution of the activated chlorine was well reproduced, giving faith in the technique, although absolute modeled ClO amounts were smaller than the MLS data. A larger number of domain-filling isentropic trajectories were also run at 475 K to produce a higher-resolution picture of vortex evolution in late January 1992. The model successfully reproduced the wave breaking events which characterized this period causing transport of activated air to lower latitudes.},

If HONO is formed on the surface of carbonaceous aerosols then this could be a significant source of HOx, as HONO is readily photolyzed to give OH, and it could explain the large values of HONO often observed in the troposphere. In general, the reduction of NOy on carbonaceous aerosols is an important consideration, and it is addressed here.},

	abstract     = {Drought can negatively impact pod production despite the fact that cacao production usually occurs in tropical areas having high rainfall. Polyamines (PAs) have been associated with the response of plants to drought in addition to their roles in responses to many other stresses. The constitutive and drought inducible expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes involved in PA biosynthesis were determined: an ornithine decarboxylase (TcODC), an arginine decarboxylase (TcADC), an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (TcSAMDC), a spermidine synthase (TcSPDS), and a spermine synthase (TcSPMS). Expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (QPCR) results showed that the PA biosynthesis genes were expressed in all plant tissues examined. Constitutive expression of PA biosynthesis genes was generally highest in mature leaves and open flowers. Expression of TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC was induced with the onset of drought and correlated with changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, photosystem II efficiency, leaf water potential and altered emission of blue-green fluorescence from cacao leaves. Induction of TcSAMDC in leaves was most closely correlated with changes in water potential. The earliest measured responses to drought were enhanced expression of TcADC and TcSAMDC in roots along with decreases in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and photosystem II efficiency. Elevated levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were detected in cacao leaves 13days after the onset of drought. Expression of all five PA associated transcripts was enhanced (1.5-3-fold) in response to treatment with abscisic acid. TcODC and TcADC, were also responsive to mechanical wounding, infection by Phytophthora megakarya (a causal agent of black pod disease in cacao), the necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein (Nep1) of Fusarium oxysporum, and flower abscission. TcSAMDC expression was responsive to all stresses except flower abscission. TcODC, although constitutively expressed at much lower levels than TcADC, TcSAMDC, TcSPDS, and TcSPMS, was highly inducible by the fungal protein Nep1 (135-fold) and the cacao pathogen Phytophthora megakarya (671-fold). The full length cDNA for ODC was cloned and characterized. Among the genes studied, TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC were most sensitive to induction by drought in addition to other abiotic and biotic stresses. TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC may share signal transduction pathways and/or the stress induced signal induction pathways may converge at these three genes leading to similar although not identical patterns of expression. It is possible altering PA levels in cacao will result in enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses including drought and disease as has been demonstrated in other crops.},

	abstract     = {The role of halogens in both the marine boundary layer and the stratosphere has long been recognized, while their role in the free troposphere is often not considered in global chemical models. However, a careful examination of free-tropospheric chemistry constrained by observations using a full chemical data assimilation system shows that halogens do play a significant role in the free troposphere. In particular, the chlorine initiation of methane oxidation in the free troposphere can contribute more than 10%, and in some regions up to 50%, of the total rate of initiation. The initiation of methane oxidation by chlorine is particularly important below the polar vortex and in northern mid-latitudes. Likewise, the hydrolysis of BrONO2 alone can contribute more than 35% of the HNO3 production rate in the free-troposphere.},

It turns out that for long-lived tracers such as N2O and CH4 the representativeness uncertainty is markedly different from the observational uncertainty and clearly delineates mixing barriers such as the polar vortex edge, the tropical pipe and the tropopause.

The spectrum of HOBr shows two main absorption bands with maxima near 282 nm (sigma=(3.1 +/- 0.4)x10(-19) cm(2) molecule(-1) and 350 nm (sigma=12.5 +/- 1.6)x10(-20) cm(2) molecule(-1)) extending out to 430 nm. The absorption cross-sections in the first absorption band are in good agreement with a recent determination; the cross-sections in the second band however, are approximately a factor of 2.5 larger than previously determined, In addition we provide evidence in support of a weak band in HOBr around 440 nm (sigma approximate to 7.5x10(-21) cm(2) molecule(-1)) as observed by Barnes et al. {[}1996]. The absorption cm cross-section of Br2O, which was used to prepare HOBr, was determined over the wavelength range 230 to 750 nm. The spectrum shows four absorption bands with maxima at 314 nm (sigma=(2.1 +/- 0.3)x10(-18) cm(2) molecule(-1)), 350 nm (sigma=(1.9 +/- 0.2)x10(-18) cm(2) molecule(-1)), 520 nm (sigma=(4.4 +/- 0.5)x10(-20) cm(2) molecule(-1)), and 665 nm (sigma=(6.2 +/- 0.9)x10(-20) cm(2) molecule(-1)). The visible bands at 520 nm cm and 660 nm have not been observed previously The equilibrium constant, for the reaction Br2O + H2O double left right arrow 2HOBr was determined to be 0.037 +/- 0.004 at 298 K. Measurement of the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature enabled values for Delta H-298 K = (13.0 +/- 0.5) kJ mol(-1) and Delta S-298 K = (16 +/- 2) J mol(-1) K-1 to be determined. The absorption cross-section data for HOBr have been used in a photochemical box model to investigate the significance of these results in the lower stratosphere. The model results are compared with observations during a recent Stratospheric Photochemistry, Aerosols and Dynamics Expedition (SPADE) and show that the revised HOBr cross-section, coupled to the rapid heterogeneous conversion of BrONO2 to HOBr, can account quantitatively for the abrupt morning rise in HOx.},

Between 1998 and 2004 the stratospheric loading of HCl was relatively constant, with some month to month fluctuation; this was followed by a more pronounced decrease in HCl since 2004. We use probability distribution functions ( PDFs) and scatter diagrams for validation and bias characterization of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS) HCl retrievals. Both these methods allow us to use large statistical samples and do not require correlative measurements to be colocated in space and time. The bias between the Halogen Occultation Experiment ( HALOE) and Aura MLS is greatest above the 525 K ( similar to 21 km) isentropic surface. The global average mean bias between Aura and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE) for January 2005 was 2% and between Aura MLS and HALOE was 14%. The widths of the PDFs are a measure of the spatial variability and measurement precision. The Aura MLS HCl PDFs are consistently wider than those for ACE and HALOE, this reflects the retrieval uncertainties. The median observation uncertainty for Aura MLS v1.51 HCl is 12%, and the median ACE v2.2 uncertainty is 8%. We also connect Aura MLS HCl with the heritage of HALOE HCl by using neural networks to learn the interinstrument biases and provide a seamless HCl record from the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS) in 1991 to the present.},

	abstract     = {This paper considers the effect of heterogeneous bromine reactions on stratospheric photochemistry. We have considered reactions on both sulfate aerosols and on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), It is shown that the hydrolysis of BrONO2 on sulfate aerosols enhances the HOBr concentration, which in turn enhances the OH and HO2 concentrations, thereby reducing the HCl lifetime and concentration. The hydrolysis of BrONO2 leads to a nighttime production of HOBr, making HOBr a major nighttime bromine reservoir. The photolysis of HOBr gives a rapid increase in the OH and HO2 concentration at dawn, as was recently observed by Salawitch et al. {[}1994]. The increase in the OH and HO2 concentration, and the decrease in the HCl concentration, leads to additional ozone depletion at all latitudes and for all season. At temperatures below 210 K the bulk phase reaction of HOBr with HCl in sulfate aerosols becomes important. The most important heterogeneous bromine reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are the mixed halogen reactions of HCl with HOBr and BrONO2 and of HBr with HOCl and ClONO2.},

The study is aided by data from a 6-week parameterized-chemistry run of the Goddard Space Flight Center 3D Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM), initialized on 8 December 1991. Generally, CO mixing ratios increase with height due to the increasing source contribution from CO2 photolysis. In the tropical upper stratosphere, however, a local maximum in CO mixing ratio occurs. A simple photochemical model is used to show that this feature results largely from methane oxidation. In the extratropics the photochemical lifetime of CO is long, and therefore its evolution is dictated by large scale motion of air, evidenced by strong correlation with Ertel potential vorticity. This makes CO one of the few useful observable tracers at the stratopause level and above. Thus CO maps are used to study the synoptic evolution of the polar vortex in early January 1992. Modified Lagrangian mean mixing diagnostics are applied to ISAMS and CTM data to examine the strength of the mixing barrier at the polar vortex edge. It is demonstrated that planetary wave activity weakens the barrier, promoting vortex erosion. The vortex erosion first appears in the lower mesosphere and subsequently descends through the upper stratosphere, and is attributed to effects of planetary wave dissipation. Agreement between ISAMS and CTM is good in the horizontal distribution of CO throughout the examined period, but vertical CO gradients in the CTM weaken with time relative to the ISAMS observations.}

	abstract     = {The peak in stratospheric HCl was reached in the late 1990s. Between 1998 and 2004 the stratospheric loading of HCl was relatively constant, with some month to month fluctuation; this was followed by a more pronounced decrease in HCl since 2004. We use probability distribution functions ( PDFs) and scatter diagrams for validation and bias characterization of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS) HCl retrievals. Both these methods allow us to use large statistical samples and do not require correlative measurements to be colocated in space and time. The bias between the Halogen Occultation Experiment ( HALOE) and Aura MLS is greatest above the 525 K ( similar to 21 km) isentropic surface. The global average mean bias between Aura and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE) for January 2005 was 2% and between Aura MLS and HALOE was 14%. The widths of the PDFs are a measure of the spatial variability and measurement precision. The Aura MLS HCl PDFs are consistently wider than those for ACE and HALOE, this reflects the retrieval uncertainties. The median observation uncertainty for Aura MLS v1.51 HCl is 12%, and the median ACE v2.2 uncertainty is 8%. We also connect Aura MLS HCl with the heritage of HALOE HCl by using neural networks to learn the interinstrument biases and provide a seamless HCl record from the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS) in 1991 to the present.}

We use these results to develop the theory explaining both Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) and QBO driven fluctuations in tropical trace gases. For H2O, BDC variations drive part of the tropopause annual forcing through annual variations in the temperature as has been shown previously. For CO, the annual variations in the BDC amplify the annual fluctuations in CO at the tropopause as has recently been shown by Randel et al (2007). In both cases, the tropopause signal is carried upward by the mean BDC. For ozone, N2O, HCl and other gases, photochemical processes force fluctuations in the trace gases to be synchronized with annual and QBO variations in the zonal mean residual vertical velocity as is shown using lag correlations.},

However, the numerical implementation of the model introduced here is vastly more economical and efficient than that of the model by DeMajistre et al. This is because the two differential equations solved numerically by DeMajistre et al. have been which reduced them to only one simple expression. The effects of refraction on stratospheric chemistry calculated with this new model are shown to be greatest in the polar lower stratosphere close to the onset and completion of polar night. The main effect is to change the shape of the seasonal cycle of reactive species produced by photolysis such as NO, NO2, OH, HO2, Cl, ClO, Br, and BrO during the onset and completion of polar night.}

Consequently, accurately predicting the daily concentration of airborne pollen is of significant public benefit in providing timely alerts. This study presents a method for the robust estimation of the concentration of airborneAmbrosia pollen using a suite of machine learning approaches including deep learning and ensemble learners. Each of these machine learning approaches utilize data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric weather and land surface reanalysis. The machine learning approaches used for developing a suite of empirical models are deep neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, random forests and Bayesian ridge regression methods for developing our predictive model. The training data included twenty-four years of daily pollen concentration measurements together with ECMWF weather and land surface reanalysis data from 1987 to 2011 is used to develop the machine learning predictive models. The last six years of the dataset from 2012 to 2017 is used to independently test the performance of the machine learning models. The correlation coefficients between the estimated and actual pollen abundance for the independent validation datasets for the deep neural networks, random forest, extreme gradient boosting and Bayesian ridge were 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 and 0.75 respectively, showing that machine learning can be used to effectively forecast the concentrations of airborne pollen.},

In this paper, we present a general framework towards identifying relevant set of variables responsible for the observed bias. We present a general framework to identify the possible factors influencing the bias, which might be associated with the measurement conditions such as the solar and sensor zenith angles, the solar and sensor azimuth, scattering angles, and surface reflectivity at the various measured wavelengths, etc. Specifically, we performed analysis for remote sensing Aqua-Land data set, and used machine learning technique, neural network in this case, to perform multivariate regression between the ground-truth and the training data sets. Finally, we used mutual information between the observed and the predicted values as the measure of similarity to identify the most relevant set of variables. The search is brute force method as we have to consider all possible combinations. The computations involves a huge number crunching exercise, and we implemented it by writing a job-parallel program. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The so called pushbroom sensor technology is the most widespread realization of hyperspectral camera. Such cameras capture a single row of pixels, but each pixel can have hundreds of associated frequency bands. Assembling a full image from these pixel rows typically requires having a precise knowledge of the movement of the camera in space while it scans the desired area. In this research we present a procedure to build hyperspectral images from line sensor data without camera position information. The approach relies on an accompanying conventional camera and exploits the homographies between images of planar scenes for image mosaic construction. The hyperspectral camera is geometrically calibrated by using a special target and a variation of the Direct Linear Transform algorithm. This enables mapping the hyperspectral lines to each of the images in the mosaic, and a hyperspectral image can be built using the same homographies computed for the mosaic. Ideally, this research can enable small UAVs to perform enhanced detection and navigation previously reserved for high altitude aircraft.}

A good example of this is how the US-95 corridor is clearly visible in NASA Aura OMI observations of NO2. Thus, those living in close proximity to this corridor are at higher risk of adverse health outcomes, independent of socioeconomic status, age, and gender. The database is of utility for a variety of health and national security decision support tools. This level of resolution has never previously been applied to large-sample health data.

	abstract     = {This paper considers the effect of heterogeneous bromine reactions on stratospheric photochemistry. We have considered reactions on both sulfate aerosols and on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), It is shown that the hydrolysis of BrONO2 on sulfate aerosols enhances the HOBr concentration, which in turn enhances the OH and HO2 concentrations, thereby reducing the HCl lifetime and concentration. The hydrolysis of BrONO2 leads to a nighttime production of HOBr, making HOBr a major nighttime bromine reservoir. The photolysis of HOBr gives a rapid increase in the OH and HO2 concentration at dawn, as was recently observed by Salawitch et al. {[}1994]. The increase in the OH and HO2 concentration, and the decrease in the HCl concentration, leads to additional ozone depletion at all latitudes and for all season. At temperatures below 210 K the bulk phase reaction of HOBr with HCl in sulfate aerosols becomes important. The most important heterogeneous bromine reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are the mixed halogen reactions of HCl with HOBr and BrONO2 and of HBr with HOCl and ClONO2.},

	abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) radiative-dynamical-chemical model has been developed and used to study the evolution of trace gases in the Arctic lower stratosphere during winter 1989-1990. A series of 10-day model integrations were performed throughout this period. The model includes a comprehensive scheme of gas phase chemical reactions as well as a parameterization of heterogeneous reactions occurring on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) surfaces. An important element of a 3D chemical model is the transport scheme. In this study the transport of chemical species is achieved by a non diffusive method well suited to the preservation of sharp gradients. During the winter studied temperatures were cold enough for the formation of both type I and type II polar stratospheric clouds from early December to early February. Model simulations in late December show that inside the polar vortex air is rapidly processed by polar stratospheric clouds converting HCl and ClONO2 to active chlorine. The possibility of ozone destruction depends strongly on the amount of sunlight. In early February an average ozone loss of 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) /day is predicted in PSC-processed air at 50 hPa. giving a column loss of just under 1 DU/day. This loss increases to 25 ppbv/day if PSCs persist until March with a column loss of around 1.5 DU/day. The relatively small magnitude of the ozone loss predicted in the model, compared to the variability of ozone induced by dynamics, highlights the problems in identifying the signature of chemical ozone loss in the Arctic. In future years significant ozone depletion could occur if PSCs persist until late March. rhe efficiency of the catalytic cycles responsible for the ozone loss has been analyzed as a function of latitude, altitude and time. In general, the cycle involving ClO + ClO is the dominant loss mechanism in the polar lower stratosphere. Cycles involving BrO can make a relatively large contribution early in the season and when the levels of CIO are low. The cycle initiated by ClO + O destroys ozone at altitudes above 30 hPa but the loss is compensated, to some extent, by in situ ozone production. The results for trace species are validated, where possible, by comparison with the available measurements, although the sparse nature of the observations does not effectively constrain the model.},

With only a 1-2% yield of HBr the modelled HBr mixing ratio between 20-30 km increases from around 0.5 parts per 10(12) by volume (pptv) to 1-2 pptv. This brings the model into agreement with recent balloon-borne observations of stratospheric HBr. Should BrO + OK produce HBr with around 1-2% yield then this reaction will dominate HBr production between 20-35 km.

Examples are shown from the launch of UARS through to the present. This approach is also useful to evaluate the consistency among Aura instruments as well as their agreement with other datasets. A key feature of this work is putting the observations of Aura in their long-term historical context via statistical comparisons with previous datasets collected over more than a decade. To validate the Aura data, we use data from a variety of platforms including solar occultation (Canadian ACE) and limb sounder satellite instruments, ozonesondes (WOUDC), lidar (NDSC), and aircraft instruments (AVE, PAVE, and MOZAIC). The width of the trace gas PDFs can be used to accurately estimate the atmospheric spatial variability (or representativeness uncertainty) of trace gases as a function of time and location. This statistical analysis is also being used as preparation for full Kalman filter chemical assimilations. The analysis is presented online at http://ww-tv.PDFCentral.info.},

This technique involves integrating a photochemical package along a large number of independent trajectories to produce a Lagrangian view of the atmosphere. Although Lagrangian chemical modeling with trajectories is an established procedure, this extension of integrating chemistry along a large number of domain-filling trajectories is a novel technique. This technique is complementary to three-dimensional Eulerian chemical transport modeling and avoids spurious mixing caused by low resolutions or diffusive transport schemes in these models. We illustrate the technique by studying the chlorine activation in the Arctic winter lower stratosphere. A photochemical model was integrated along large ensembles of calculated trajectories between 20 and 100 mbar for the 1991/1992 winter in order to produce a three-dimensional chemical picture. Large amounts of chlorine was activated at low altitudes (80 to 100 mbar) as well as altitudes near 50 mbar. This activated air was well contained at all levels, with little indication of mixing into lower latitudes. Model results for early January 1992 were compared to daily Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) ClO observations at 465 K. The structure and evolution of the activated chlorine was well reproduced, giving faith in the technique, although absolute modeled ClO amounts were smaller than the MLS data. A larger number of domain-filling isentropic trajectories were also run at 475 K to produce a higher-resolution picture of vortex evolution in late January 1992. The model successfully reproduced the wave breaking events which characterized this period causing transport of activated air to lower latitudes.},

The calculated rate of methane oxidation is increased by at least 20% in the upper troposphere when halogen catalysis is included. In the lower stratosphere, approximately 25% of methane oxidation can be initiated by chlorine; the precise fraction is very temperature dependent. Including halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation increases the HOx and ClOx concentrations and decreases the NOx concentration. The calculated enhancement in the HOx concentration due to halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is around 10-15% in the lower stratosphere; and around 20% in the upper troposphere. The decrease in the NOx concentration is around 10% in the upper troposphere. The enhancement in the ClOx concentration is around 7-10% in the lower stratosphere. The increase in the calculated HOx and ClOx concentrations and the decrease in the NOx concentration lead to a enhancement in the calculated O-3 loss. The additional O-3 loss calculated is most significant in the upper troposphere where over a 7-day simulation it was of the order of 0.1-1% for midlatitudes at equinox. As the atmospheric loading of chlorine drops the gross odd-oxygen production by NO + HO2 will increase, so there will be an accelerated ozone recovery. On a per molecule basis, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than chlorine catalyzed methane oxidation. In the upper troposphere bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation destroys ozone at a rate which is approximately one: third of that at which nitrogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is producing ozone. Therefore, with the increasing atmospheric bromine loading, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is set to become more important. It would be valuable to have kinetic studies of the reaction BrO with CH3O2 so that the role of bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation can be quantified more precisely.},

	abstract     = {Drought can negatively impact pod production despite the fact that cacao production usually occurs in tropical areas having high rainfall. Polyamines (PAs) have been associated with the response of plants to drought in addition to their roles in responses to many other stresses. The constitutive and drought inducible expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes involved in PA biosynthesis were determined: an ornithine decarboxylase (TcODC), an arginine decarboxylase (TcADC), an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (TcSAMDC), a spermidine synthase (TcSPDS), and a spermine synthase (TcSPMS). Expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (QPCR) results showed that the PA biosynthesis genes were expressed in all plant tissues examined. Constitutive expression of PA biosynthesis genes was generally highest in mature leaves and open flowers. Expression of TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC was induced with the onset of drought and correlated with changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, photosystem II efficiency, leaf water potential and altered emission of blue-green fluorescence from cacao leaves. Induction of TcSAMDC in leaves was most closely correlated with changes in water potential. The earliest measured responses to drought were enhanced expression of TcADC and TcSAMDC in roots along with decreases in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and photosystem II efficiency. Elevated levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were detected in cacao leaves 13days after the onset of drought. Expression of all five PA associated transcripts was enhanced (1.5-3-fold) in response to treatment with abscisic acid. TcODC and TcADC, were also responsive to mechanical wounding, infection by Phytophthora megakarya (a causal agent of black pod disease in cacao), the necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein (Nep1) of Fusarium oxysporum, and flower abscission. TcSAMDC expression was responsive to all stresses except flower abscission. TcODC, although constitutively expressed at much lower levels than TcADC, TcSAMDC, TcSPDS, and TcSPMS, was highly inducible by the fungal protein Nep1 (135-fold) and the cacao pathogen Phytophthora megakarya (671-fold). The full length cDNA for ODC was cloned and characterized. Among the genes studied, TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC were most sensitive to induction by drought in addition to other abiotic and biotic stresses. TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC may share signal transduction pathways and/or the stress induced signal induction pathways may converge at these three genes leading to similar although not identical patterns of expression. It is possible altering PA levels in cacao will result in enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses including drought and disease as has been demonstrated in other crops.},

If HONO is formed on the surface of carbonaceous aerosols then this could be a significant source of HOx, as HONO is readily photolyzed to give OH, and it could explain the large values of HONO often observed in the troposphere.

The goal of the chemistry data assimilation is to combine an atmospheric-chemistry model and actual observations to produce the best estimate of the chemistry of the atmosphere. The observational dataset collected during the past decades is an unprecedented expansion of our knowledge of the atmosphere. The exploitation of these data is the best way to advance our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, and to develop chemistry models for chemistry-climate prediction. The assimilation focuses on estimating the state of the chemistry in a chemically and dynamically consistent manner (if the model allows online interactions between chemistry and dynamics). In so doing, we can: produce simultaneous and chemically consistent estimates of all species (including model parameters), observed and unobserved; fill in data voids; test the photochemical theories used in the chemistry models. In this paper, the Hilbert space is first formulated from the geometric structure of the Banach space, followed by the development of the adjoint operator in Hilbert space. The principle of the adjoint method is described, followed by two examples which show the relationship of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the Output vector and the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input vector. Applications to chemistry data assimilation are presented for both continuous and discrete cases. The 4D data variational adjoint method is then tested in the assimilation of stratospheric chemistry using a simple catalytic ozone-destruction mechanism, and the test results indicate that the performance of the assimilation method is good.},

Demands of the indoor environmental quality within the classroom generally vary with the education levels and result in ventilation energy consumption accounting for a considerable proportion of the total energy use in bulk educational buildings. Its huge energy-saving potential is attracting worldwide attention from scholars and governments. Therefore, appropriate operation strategies of ventilation systems should be adopted to effectively reduce energy consumption without sacrificing thermal comfort and IAQ. However, the absence of relevant standards and guidelines for designing a quality classroom environment considering the special features of educational buildings remains an important research question. This study conducts a comprehensive review to determine research gaps and identify future directions for the interaction between thermal comfort, IAQ and ventilation energy consumption for educational buildings. The review results show that: (1) The thermal comfort prediction model should consider the influences of genders, ages and socioeconomic backgrounds; (2) The mixed-mode ventilation coupling the natural and mechanical approaches is preferred given its advantage of lower energy consumption and improved thermal comfort, but its control strategies need further exploration; (3) Optimizing passive design parameters of buildings (e.g., window to wall ratios, window orientations and sun shading installations) can significantly reduce the ventilation demands while maintaining indoor thermal comfort; (4) More studies are required for investigating thermal comfort in educational buildings during the heating period; and (5) IAQ of university buildings clearly requires further studies, especially on bacterial and fungal aerosol pollutants, for a more comprehensive assessment of the built environment.},

	abstract     = {The cost of nosocomial infections in the United States is estimated to be \$4 billion to \$5 billion annually. Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design ,i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.},

Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 air changes per hour (ACH) for prevention of aerosol transmission of COVID-19 in classrooms. Teachers reported noise generated by DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 μm (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5” MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averages 77\% after six months compared to 92\% for newly installed filters. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for \$200-\$650 with DIY versus \$600-\$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20\% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH.

	abstract     = {HVAC ﬁlters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality consequences of high efﬁciency ﬁlters installed in commercial buildings. To explore these effects, system airﬂow, ﬁlter and coil pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four ﬁlter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were estimated for a large dataset of ﬁlters divided into four efﬁciency (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan speed control showed that increased ﬁlter pressure drop decreased ﬂow, cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy consumption (2e4\%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy savings during fan-only mode (8e13\%) in units without fan speed control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11e18\%) in the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5 (2.9e3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger beneﬁts achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of ﬁltration is essential to selecting the appropriate efﬁciency of ﬁlters that ensures low-energy use and a healthy indoor environment.},

Ventilation strategies included the protocols issued by the Public Administration, while others were developed based on the typological configuration and use of the school. Results revealed that it is advisable to implement certain strategies that reduce the risk of infection among the occupants of the spaces, without a significant decrease in hygrothermal comfort. Given the importance of maintaining better IAQ in the future within classrooms, and regarding the pre-COVID situation, these strategies may be extended beyond this pandemic period, through a simple protocol and necessary didactic package to be assumed by both teachers and students of the centre.},

Pollutants that worsen indoor atmosphere include gaseous and particulate matter (PM), and the eﬀects and diﬀusion characteristics that inﬂuence indoor atmosphere vary depending on the indoor and outdoor concentration. White dust is a PM generated from minerals in water used for humidiﬁers during winter. Therefore, studies on the impact of white dust on human health and its size distribution are being actively conducted. However, since the indoor PM concentration varies depending on the humidiﬁcation method and water type used, relevant studies are needed. Accordingly, this study examined the change in the PM2.5 concentration and relative humidity on the basis of water types and humidiﬁcation method. It was found that the indoor PM2.5 concentration varied from 16 to 350 ug/m3, depending on the water types used for an ultrasonic humidiﬁer. Conversely, when using a natural evaporative humidiﬁer, white dust did not increase the indoor PM2.5 concentration, regardless of the mineral content of the water used. Considering both humidiﬁcation ability and continuous humidiﬁer use indoors, water puriﬁer with nano-trap ﬁlters must be utilized for ultrasonic humidiﬁers.},

These include escalation of energy costs, heightened awareness about acceptable IAQ, aging of the commercial building inventory, numerous revisions and addenda to ventilation standards and building codes, and green building/sustainability initiatives and energy tax credits. A field study was performed on established installations of particulate and gas-phase filtration in and around Atlanta, Georgia (USA) and included a variety of building types and usage and evaluated environmental conditions and airborne contaminants. The study was undertaken in two parts with Phase I being to establish and finalize test and measurement protocols and a Phase II field investigation. This paper provides a summary of both Phases, including characteristics of untreated outdoor air, and air cleaning with particulate filters and gas-phase air filtration. Overall, there was a TVOC reduction of 38-74\%, 0.5 µm particulate removal efficiency of 28-95\%, and an ozone removal efficiency of 100\%. Each building had annual operational cost savings ranging between US\$10,000 and US\$800,000. The field study is intended to establish the parameters of dilution air compared with similar characteristics of air treated with particulate and gas-phase filtration. The field study demonstrated that filtered air can meet or exceed the IAQ level from simple dilution with outdoor air. The study also documents the comparable energy savings as a result of a reduction in outdoor air ventilation rates and significant control of specific contaminants of concern regarding occupant safety and building security.},

Despite common assumptions, measurements have shown that typical U.S. commercial buildings are not particularly airtight. Past simulation studies have shown that commercial building envelope leakage can result in significant heating and cooling loads. To evaluate the potential energy savings of an effective air barrier requirement, annual energy simulations were prepared for three nonresidential buildings (a two-story office building, a one-story retail building, and a four-story apartment building) in 5 U.S. cities. A coupled multizone airflow and building energy simulation tool was used to predict the energy use for the buildings at a target tightness level relative to a baseline level based on measurements in existing buildings. Based on assumed blended national average heating and cooling energy prices, predicted potential annual heating and cooling energy cost savings ranged from 3 \% to 36 \% with the smallest savings occurring in the cooling-dominated climates of Phoenix and Miami. In order to put these estimated energy savings in context, a cost effectiveness calculation was performed using the scalar ratio methodology employed by ASHRAE SSPC 90.1.},

	abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern of viral spread within buildings. Although near-field transmission and infectious spread within individual rooms are well studied, the impact of aerosolized spread of SARS-CoV-2 via air handling systems within multiroom buildings remains unexplored. This study evaluates the concentra­ tions and probabilities of infection for both building interior and exterior exposure sources using a well-mixed model in a multiroom building served by a central air handling system (without packaged terminal air condi­ tioning). In particular, we compare the influence of filtration, air change rates, and the fraction of outdoor air. When the air supplied to the rooms comprises both outdoor air and recirculated air, we find filtration lowers the concentration and probability of infection the most in connected rooms. We find that increasing the air change rate removes virus from the source room faster but also increases the rate of exposure in connected rooms. Therefore, slower air change rates reduce infectivity in connected rooms at shorter durations. We further find that increasing the fraction of virus-free outdoor air is helpful, unless outdoor air is infective in which case pathogen exposure inside persists for hours after a short-term release. Increasing the outdoor air to 33\% or the filter to MERV-13 decreases the infectivity in the connected rooms by 19\% or 93\% respectively, relative to a MERV-8 filter with 9\% outdoor air based on 100 quanta/h of 5 μm droplets, a breathing rate of 0.48 m3/h, and the building dimensions and air handling system considered.},

		“Most of the docu mented spread of the disease has occurred within buildings, and a majority of the “superspreader” events where multiple individuals have been infected occurred at least partially in buildings [” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 1)

		“These findings, coupled with mounting evidence of airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 [5,6], raise serious questions about the extent to which the virus may spread to connected rooms through HVAC systems” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 1) “In general, models of aerosolized pathogen spread throughout buildings divide into those that account for local concentration gradients, typically using computational fluid dynamics codes (e.g., Ref. [9] for recirculation flows within elevators, classrooms, and supermarkets using a single room formulation inclusive of obstacles), and those that neglect concentration gradients and use well-mixed models [10]. Thus far, most models of virus spread generally, and SARS-CoV-2 specifically, use well-mixed models. For example, Yang and Marr [11] predicted the evolving size distribution as a function of time for influenza A viruses in a well-mixed room to find that increased air change rates reduce the concentration of the virus within a well-mixed space faster.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 2)

		“In summary, we evaluated concentrations and probabilities of infection for both internal and external exposure sources using a wellmixed model in a building with a central HVAC system. The presented results indicate meaningful exposure via the ventilation system in support of our hypothesis.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 11) “Increasing the air changerate should also be consideredwith caution because it may increase the rate of viral aerosol spread via HVAC systems. In our study, when the ACH is increased from 1.8 to 12, the time to the peak concentration of virus in the connected rooms decreases from 30 min to 11 min.” (Pease et al., 2021, p. 11)

The student population is 62,000 with growth of 2,000 students each year - 100 new classrooms. Under this type of growth, the school district sought ways to accommodate additional students, deal with moisture and humidity, provide acceptable air quality, and limit energy consumption. In 2003, the school district used air cleaning and the IAQ Procedure of ASHRAE Standard 62.1 as part of a plan to address these issues. Four elementary schools previously housed a total of 106 portable classrooms. School additions replaced these classrooms with permanent buildings using the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure to design the HVAC outdoor air requirements. These designs reduced outdoor air requirements from a total of 41,856 cfm to 14,375 cfm, a difference of 27,480 cfm. They also evaluated air quality by modeling acetone, ammonia, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, methyl alcohol, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phenol, sulfur dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds. Positive results included the reduction of many contaminant concentrations, lower inhaler usage, and operational savings.},

They also evaluated air quality by modeling acetone, ammonia, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, methyl alcohol, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phenol, sulfur dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds. Positive results included the reduction of many contaminant concentrations, lower inhaler usage, and operational savings.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 1)

		“The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) first published their ventilation standard in 1973. The original version prescribed minimum ventilation air quantities in terms of volumetric flow rates per person (ASHRAE 1981). In 1981, the standard added the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Procedure as a performance based approach for determining minimum ventilation rates. The standard called the original method of using prescribed ventilation rates the Ventilation Rate Procedure.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 1)

		“According to the 62.1 Users Manual, engineers have used the Ventilation Rate Procedure more often than the IAQ Procedure and NEISD was the same before 2003.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 2) “overall per person ventilation rates of 15 – 20 cfm per person. Outdoor air amounts for the IAQ Procedure were 4 – 14\% of supply. Dividing these outdoor air amounts by the total occupancies yields overall per person ventilation rates of 5 – 7 cfm per person.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 3) “The average reduction in outdoor air amounts for these schools was close to 70\%.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 3)

		paradox: pulling less outdoor air is more efficient. Pulling less air through filtration reduces efficacy “First, the effectiveness of gas-phase filtration depends on the amount of air the filters contact. When the primary air flow decreases, the contaminant concentration increases; the filtration system removes less of the contaminant because it is cleaning less air.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 5) “Designs using the IAQ Procedure and gas-phase filtration must keep minimum primary flows above certain limits to provide contact time with the filters.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		“Third, internal sources with higher emission rates may prevent the use of re-circulated air with typical gas-phase and particulate filtration. These sources require local exhausts or stronger gasphase and particulate filtration equipment. Some examples of internal sources with higher emission rates may include art classrooms, janitor’s closets, kitchen areas, science laboratories, and woodwork shops.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		“For many buildings, the IAQ Procedure is an option that provides direct control of indoor air contaminants not possible under the Ventilation Rate Procedure. This provides improved indoor air quality as well as reducing the amount of energy spent on conditioning the ambient air. This makes it a powerful tool for building owners and engineers to employ.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6)

		Achieving “engineering predicted” results is unlikely given the many variables involved in optimizing building design for filtration/ventilation. This is a (hidden) cost beyond a simple retrofit. “On the mechanical side, there are several factors that must be known in order to perform IAQ and energy savings calculations and these include the amounts of outside and recirculation air, ventilation efficiency, and filter location. On the contaminant side, there are factors pertaining to geographic location, building use, air cleaner efficiencies and removal capacities.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) “Different geographic locations will require the use of several different sets of data (weather data, utility costs, etc.) that can affect the operation and performance of the HVAC system.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) Note that increased ventilation as a strategy raises massive equity issues for low income / minority neighborhoods where AQ tends to be poorer. “The most common applications, and those with the greatest potential for capital cost savings and operational cost reductions, involve new construction and renovation.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 6) And that is the key issue… to implement gas phase + particulate filtration requires significant renovation. “The IAQ Procedure is often neglected as a method for complying with the ventilation requirements of ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007.” (Lamping and Muller, p. 11)

Results showed that for cities where outdoor PM2.5 concentration is low, adopting the IAQP with low efﬁciency PM2.5 ﬁlter in grocery stores and the VRP with high PM2.5 efﬁciency in non-grocery stores yielded the greatest exposure beneﬁts. For cities with high outdoor PM2.5 concentration, adopting the VRP with high PM2.5 efﬁciency for all store types yielded the greatest exposure beneﬁts. However, these exposure beneﬁts also caused an increase in energy consumption, and the magnitude depends on the city's climate, outdoor PM2.5 concentration and the retail store type.

		“a review of ventilation measurements in retail stores found that half of the stores tested met or exceeded the VRP; nonetheless, these ventilation rates were not sufficient to keep all pollutants below their most conservative limits [11]. Specifically, there is no documentation of the adequacy of VRP in maintaining an acceptable indoor air quality in retail buildings.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“Five of these studies found that DCV was not sufficient to control the measured pollutants below their established limits. DCV-based CO2 does not generally control outdoor-generated pollutants, nor does it account for pollutants generated indoors but independently of human activities.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“In the objective assessment, the IAQP requires designers to select the ventilation rate that will keep each individual COC below its established limit. This ignores the fact that some pollutants (e.g. ozone, and some particles) can be generated outdoors, and keeping the ventilation rate to a minimum may be more advantageous from both exposure and energy perspectives.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187)

		“What is the optimal ventilationefiltration combination strategy that will lead to a balance between exposure to pollutants and energy consumption?” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 187) “The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric was chosen as the common metric of exposure to compare exposures to contaminants of concern for different control strategies, as an alternative to relying on the widely varying published health standards or guidelines. The main strength of the DALY metric is that it combines the fatal and non-fatal health outcomes into a single value (i.e. years of life lost due to death and disability) [25]. This metric is commonly used and is endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO).” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 188)

		“For a typical 10,000 m2 store, the magnitude of energy cost to achieve the maximum exposure benefits depended on the city and the retail type, ranging from \$1000 in annual cost for filtration energy in a grocery store in Los Angeles to \$24,000 as the annual cost of ventilation in a grocery store in Austin.” (Zaatari et al., 2016, p. 195)

At the same time, the operating costs of HVAC systems are often a large percentage of the total energy consumption of buildings, which constitutes 40\% of the primary energy consumed in the U.S. As efforts are pursued to reduce building energy use, which may involve reductions in outdoor air ventilation rates, it is important to consider the impacts of these measures on IAQ. To better understand the IAQ and energy trade-offs of various ventilation approaches, simulations were performed using the multizone airﬂow model, CONTAM, for a big box retail store in two climates. Annual energy simulations were also performed in EnergyPlus. Simulations included ventilating at the minimum outdoor airﬂow rate prescribed by the ASHRAE Standard 62.1e2013 Ventilation Rate Procedure during occupied hours and at a lower rate for 24 h a day. Additional cases included increasing the base outdoor air intake rates and changing the building envelope airtightness. Annual airﬂow and contaminant (carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, ozone, particulate matter, and a generic volatile organic compound) simulations were performed using emission rates from previous studies of retail buildings. This study demonstrated that ventilating at a lower rate for 24 h a day saved energy compared with ventilating at the higher rate prescribed in ASHRAE 62.1 and that the simulated indoor contaminant concentrations did not exceed common benchmarks or health guidelines.},

These recommendations were subsequently transformed into more rigorous standards and guidance in the 20th century, with the ﬁrst version of ASHRAE Standard 62 published in 1973.

This paper reviews and discusses some of the issues that have been addressed in the development of ventilation standards in recent years, using the development of ASHRAE Standard 62 as context, including: the scientiﬁc bases for ventilation requirements, perceived indoor air quality, contaminant sources from occupants and the building, outdoor air quality, airborne contaminant limits, indoor carbon dioxide concentrations, environmental tobacco smoke, and performance-based design.

Their report stated that the 15 L/s per person requirement was not justified and that 5 L/s to 7.5 L/s per person was adequate for classrooms.” (Persily, 2015, p. 62) “1946 when the American Standards Association issued a standard that required lighting and ventilation in all habitable rooms through the use of windows” (Persily, 2015, p. 62)

		“Those rates were 2.5 L/s m2 in offices and 7.6 L/ sm2 in public buildings including schools, which translate to 50 L/s per person in offices and 22 L/s in classrooms based on the default occupancy densities” (Persily, 2015, p. 62)

		“ASHRAE Standard 62, and its subsequent incarnations as Standard 62.1 (covering commercial, institutional and high-rise residential) and Standard 62.2 (low-rise residential), has served as one of the most prominent ventilation standards since it was first published in 1973” (Persily, 2015, p. 62) “Ventilation rate requirements for different space types have been revisited in subsequent versions of Standard 62 since it was originally published in 1973, as well as in other standards.” (Persily, 2015, p. 63)

		“In 2004, Standard 62 was split into two standards, 62.1 covering commercial, institutional and high-rise residential buildings and 62.2 covering low-rise residential.” (Persily, 2015, p. 63) “It is well recognized that for ventilation to have a positive impact on IAQ, the air brought into the building must be relatively free of contaminants generated indoors as well as key outdoor air contaminants.” (Persily, 2015, p. 65)

		“The committee discussed other outdoor contaminants that are commonly at high concentrations, such as CO, but the lack of either practical air cleaning equipment or rating methods resulted in those contaminants not being addressed.” (Persily, 2015, p. 65)

		“ASHRAE Standard 62-1981 also introduced the Indoor Air Quality Procedure, the alternative, performance-based design approach, which is discussed below.” (Persily, 2015, p. 66)

		“Both the U.S. Green Building Council LEED rating system [33]and ASHRAE/USGBC/IES Standard 189.1 [46], Standard for the Design of High-Performance Green Buildings, include contaminant limits as an alternative to conducting a building flush out after construction but before occupancy.” (Persily, 2015, p. 66) “The CDPH document is a standard for testing and evaluating VOC emissions from building materials in chambers and contains a list of maximum allowable concentrations for target VOCs that are equal to one-half of the Chronic Reference Exposure Levels (CRELs) issued by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). As stated in CDPH v1.1, these “CRELs are inhalation concentrations to which the general population, including sensitive individuals, may be exposed for long periods (10 years or more) without the likelihood of serious adverse systemic effects (excluding cancer).”” (Persily, 2015, p. 66)

Human VOC emissions indoors from exercise are still relatively uncertain, and questions remain about emissions from chlorinebased cleaners. To investigate these and other issues, the ATHLETic center study of Indoor Chemistry (ATHLETIC) campaign was conducted in the weight room of the Dal Ward Athletic Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. Using a Vocus Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (Vocus PTR-TOF), an Aerodyne Gas Chromatograph (GC), an Iodide-Chemical Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (I-CIMS), and Picarro cavity ringdown spectrometers, we alternated measurements between the weight room and supply air, allowing for determination of VOC, NH3, H2O, and CO2 emission rates per person (emission factors). Human-derived emission factors were higher than previous studies of measuring indoor air quality in rooms with individuals at rest and correlated with increased CO2 emission factors. Emission factors from personal care products (PCPs) were consistent with previous studies and typically decreased throughout the day.

For example, after being exhausted from buildings, these VOCs can account for over 50\% of the OH reactivity and SOA production observed in ambient air in Los Angeles.3” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324) “Humans also act as a significant source of VOCs in indoor environments due to breathing,4,5 sweating, and skin emanations.6,7” “In addition, these studies used a quadrupole PTR-MS or selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS), limiting the scope of each study to a few VOCs in order to improve time resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324)

		“Hypochlorite bleach is used to disinfect surfaces in homes, offices, pools, and gyms, possibly leading to respiratory ailments for those who work in the cleaning industry” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1324)

		This doesn’t help if typical work-outs are 1-2 hr: “Although dichlor cleaning released chlorinated compounds that are known to be detrimental to health,34-37 after the event these compounds were ventilated out of the weight room over a period of 3 hours.” (Finewax et al., 2021, p. 1336)

	abstract     = {Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and many organic chemicals contained in household cleaning products may react to generate halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Halogenated VOC emissions from eight different chlorine bleach containing household products (pure and diluted) were investigated by headspace experiments. Chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were the leading compounds along with several halogenated compounds in the headspace of chlorine bleach products. One of the most surprising results was the presence of carbon tetrachloride (a probable human carcinogen and a powerful greenhouse gas that was banned for household use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) in very high concentrations (up to 101 mg m−3). By mixing surfactants or soap with NaOCl, it was shown that the formation of carbon tetrachloride and several other halogenated VOCs is possible. In addition to quantitatively determined halogenated VOCs (n = 15), several nitrogen-containing (n = 4), chlorinated (n = 10), oxygenated compounds (n = 22), and hydrocarbons (n = 14) were identified in the headspace of bleach products. Among these, 1,1-dichlorobutane and 2-chloro-2-nitropropane were the most abundant chlorinated VOCs, whereas trichloronitromethane and hexachloroethane were the most frequently detected ones. Indoor air halogenated VOC concentrations resulting from the use of four selected household products were also measured before, during, and 30 min after bathroom, kitchen, and floor cleaning applications. Chloroform (2.9–24.6 µg m−3) and carbon tetrachloride (0.25–459 µg m−3) concentrations significantly increased during the use of bleach containing products. During/before concentration ratios ranged between 8 and 52 (25 ± 14, average ± SD) for chloroform and 1–1170 (146 ± 367, average ± SD) for carbon tetrachloride, respectively. These results indicated that the bleach use can be important in terms of inhalation exposure to carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and several other halogenated VOCs.}

	abstract     = {Abstract Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a global challenge incurring mortalities and high treatment costs. The environment plays an important role in transmission due to contaminated air and surfaces. This includes microorganisms' deposition from the air onto surfaces. Quantifying the deposition rate of microorganisms enables understanding surface contamination and can inform strategies to mitigate the infection risk. We developed and validated a novel Automated Multiplate Passive Air Sampling (AMPAS) device. This enables sequences of passive deposition samples to be collected over a controlled time period without human intervention. AMPAS was used with air sampling to measure the effect of ventilation rate and spatial location on the deposition rate of aerosolized Staphylococcus aureus in a 32 m3 chamber. Increasing the ventilation rate from 3 to 6 ACH results in a reduction of microbial load in the air and on surfaces by 45\% ± 10\% and 44\% ± 32\%, respectively. The deposition rate onto internal surfaces λd was calculated as 1.38 ± 0.48 h−1. Samples of airborne and surface microorganisms taken closer to the ventilation supply showed a lower concentration than close to the extract. The findings support the importance of controlling the ventilation and the environmental parameters to mitigate both air and surface infection risks in the hospital environment.}

In this study, the possible relationships between PM2.5, microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in an urban area of Bushehr port, in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Presence, sources, and health risks of MPs and PAHs in both normal and dusty days were also investigated. The median of PM2.5 and ƩPAHs were 52.8 $\mu$g/m3 and 14.1 ng/m3, respectively, indicating high pollution levels especially in dusty days. The mean level of MPs in urban suspended PM2.5 was 5.2 items/m3. Fragments were the most abundant shape of identified MPs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the most plastic types in urban dust of Bushehr port. The results revealed that PM2.5 and MPs may possibly act as a carrier for airborne MPs and PAHs, respectively. In addition, the significant positive relationships between MPs, wind speed and wind direction, confirmed that the MPs transportation were highly controlled by atmospheric condition. Moreover, the source identification methods and trajectory analyses indicated that petrogenic sources from both proximal and distal origins play an important role in the level of PAHs. The results of chronic health risk evaluation via inhalation revealed that PM2.5-bound PAHs had high potential cancer risk in winter, while, the estimated risks for non-carcinogenic PAHs were not considerable. In the case of MPs, the assessment of human intake of MPs via inhalation highlighted the possible risks for habitants.},

Besides, air pollution adversely affects the animals and deteriorates the plant environment. The overarching objective of this review is to explore the previous researches regarding the causes and sources of air pollution, how to control it and its detrimental effects on human health. The definition of air pollution and its sources were introduced extensively. Major air pollutants and their noxious effects were detailed. Detrimental impacts of air pollution on human health and well-being were also presented.},

However, few detailed studies have investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality (IEQ). This research builds on previous work to address this. Based on the analysis of a subset of the Center for the Built Environment Occupant Indoor Environmental Quality survey database featuring 11,243 responses from 93 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-rated office buildings, this study explores the relationships between the points earned in the IEQ category and the satisfaction expressed by occupants with the qualities of their indoor environment. It was found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantively increase satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor, while the rating level, and the product and version under which certification had been awarded, did not affect workplace satisfaction. There could be several reasons for this, some of which are outside the control of designers and beyond the scope of rating systems based primarily on design intent. The challenges and priorities facing building professionals, researchers and green building certification systems are discussed for the creation of more comfortable, higher performing and healthier green-rated buildings.},

	abstract     = {Background: Ambient air pollution affects neurological function, but its association with schizophrenia risk is unclear. We investigated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NOX) as a whole and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) specifically, as well as PM10, and PM2{\textperiodcentered}5, during childhood and subsequent schizophrenia risk. Methods: People born in Denmark from 1980 to 1984 (N=230 844), who were residing in the country on their tenth birthday, and who had two Danish-born parents were followed-up from their tenth birthday until schizophrenia diagnosis or Dec 31, 2016. Mean daily exposure to each pollutant (NO2, NOX, PM10, and PM2{\textperiodcentered}5) at all of an individual's residential addresses from birth to their tenth birthday was modelled. Incidence rate ratios, cumulative incidence, and population attributable risks were calculated using survival analysis techniques. Findings: We analysed data between Aug 1, 2018, and Nov 15, 2019. Of 230 844 individuals included, 2189 cohort members were diagnosed with schizophrenia during follow-up. Higher concentrations of residential NO2 and NOX exposure during childhood were associated with subsequent elevated schizophrenia risk. People exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3 NO2 had a 1{\textperiodcentered}62 (95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}41–1{\textperiodcentered}87) times increased risk compared with people exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3. The absolute risks of developing schizophrenia by the age of 37 years when exposed to daily mean concentrations of more than 26{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3 NO2 between birth and 10 years were 1{\textperiodcentered}45% (95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}30–1{\textperiodcentered}62%) for men and 1{\textperiodcentered}03% (0{\textperiodcentered}90–1{\textperiodcentered}17) for women, whereas when exposed to a mean daily concentration of less than 14{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$g/m3, the risk was 0{\textperiodcentered}80% (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}69–0{\textperiodcentered}92%) for men and 0{\textperiodcentered}67% (0{\textperiodcentered}57–0{\textperiodcentered}79) for women. Associations between exposure to PM2{\textperiodcentered}5 or PM10 and schizophrenia risk were less consistent. Interpretation: If the association between air pollution and schizophrenia is causal, reducing ambient air pollution including NO2 and NOX could have a potentially considerable effect on lowering schizophrenia incidence at the population level. Further investigations are necessary to establish a causal relationship.

	abstract     = {Background: Short-term exposure to high level of ambient particulate matters (PM) concentrations has been linked with increased hospital admissions (HA) for schizophrenia. However, evidence is inconclusive about the added effect of multi-day exposure to high-level PM concentration on schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the durational effect of PM air pollution wave on schizophrenia. Method: Data on daily HA for schizophrenia, PM (PM2.5 and PM10) and meteorological variables over the period of 2014–2017 was collected in Jining, Shandong, China. Air pollution wave of PM was defined as ≥2 or ≥3 or ≥4 consecutive days with PM concentration ≥90th or ≥92.5th or ≥95th or ≥97.5th percentiles, respectively. A time-series Poisson regression model with duration as the variable of interest was used to evaluate the associations of PM air pollution wave with HA for schizophrenia. Results: A total of 14650 hospital admissions for schizophrenia were identified. Under various air pollution wave definitions, both PM2.5 and PM10 had significant adverse effects on schizophrenia HA. PM2.5 wave defined as ≥2 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile was associated with 4.8% (2.0%–7.6%), 4.9% (1.9%–7.9%), 5.5% (2.0%–9.2%), and 7.6% (2.9%–12.6%) increase of HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. PM2.5 waves defined as ≥3 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile respectively corresponded to 5.0% (2.3%–7.8%), 5.1% (1.9%–8.4%), 6.9% (3.0%–10.8%) and 12.0% (5.3%–19.1%) increases in HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. The most significant associations were observed on the sixth day in different lag models. Conclusions: PM air pollution wave was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for schizophrenia, with stronger associations among married and female patients.},

	abstract     = {In the manufacture of plastic containers, various materials such as additives (for example, plasticizers, stabilizers, antioxidants), polymers (for example, polystyrene [PS], polycarbonate [PC], polyvinyl chloride [PVC]) are widely used. Endocrine disrupting chemicals [EDCs] can migrate as residual monomers (for example, styrene for PS or bisphenol A [BPA] for PC) presented in polymers, as additives (for example, phthalates for PVC) used in polymer manufacturing, and/or as contaminants from the polymers depending on physicochemical conditions such as temperature, UV light, pH, microwave, and mechanical stress. Some phthalates (for example, DEHP, DBP), styrene, or bisphenol have been suspected to have endocrine disrupting effects, but human toxicological effects of these compounds are very controversial. For these reasons, a comprehensive review on toxicological and risk assessment studies for these chemicals (phthalates, BPA, and styrene) was carried out to evaluate their safety in humans. On the basis of exposure estimates for the these chemicals and reference doses (RfDs), we calculated hazard index (HI = chronic daily intake/tolerable daily intake [TDI] or RfD). A HI of less than 1 suggests an exposure lower than the safety limit of the chemicals. We showed that the HI values of these chemicals were lower then 1, but there are one or several exceptions for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP; for example, exposure via infant formula, packaged lunch, total exposure), where estimated their HI values are higher than 1, which suggests an exposure higher than the safety limits of the chemicals. However, the HI of BPA was 0.001-0.26 (3.57-1000 times lower than its safety limit), and the HI for styrene was 0.276 (3.62 times lower than its safety limit). In this article, we focused on recent issues concerning the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) derived from plastic food containers or packaging. This review suggests that the use of plastic food containers might not exceed human safe limits n general with respect to endocrine disruptors aside from the exceptions of the phthalates mentioned earlier. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Food Technologists{\textregistered}.},

All the impacts will be impossible to anticipate. This review is intended to discuss significant factors related to individuals with allergic and respiratory disease. Recent Findings: Recent findings include the increased growth of allergenic plants in response to higher carbon dioxide levels and warmer temperatures. This also contributes to the increased production of pollen as well as the appearance of allergenic species in new climactic areas. Stinging insects will extend their ranges into northern areas where they have not previously been a problem. The shift and extension of pollen seasons with warmer springs and later frosts have already been observed. Recent severe hurricanes and flooding events may be just the harbinger of increasing damp housing exposure related to sea level rise. Evidence is accumulating that indicates the expected higher number of ozone alert days and increased pollution in populated areas is bringing increases in pollen potency. Finally, increased exposure to smoke and particles from wild fires, resulting from heat waves, will contribute to the general increase in respiratory disease. Summary: The practice of allergy being closely aligned with environmental conditions will be especially impacted. Allergists should consider increasing educational activities aimed at making patients more aware of air quality conditions.},

Data sheets are presented for some 78 reactions and two tables in which preferred rate parameters are presented for reactions of ethyl, i-propyl, t-butyl, and allyl radicals are given. Each data sheet sets our relevant thermodynamic data, experimental kinetic data, references, and recommended rate parameters with their error limits. A table summarizing the recommended rate data is also given. The new reactions fall into two categories: first, to expand the previous compilation relating largely to the combustion in air of methane, ethane and aromatic compounds; and second, provide data for some of the key radicals involved in the combustion of higher alkanes. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

It seeks to understand the governance dynamics during conflict in the non-government-controlled parts of Syria. It pays particular attention to civil society and state building processes. In doing so, the study spans historical and geographical width. Historically, to understand the roots of the conflict, it assesses the state-civil society-market dynamics of governance in Syria prior to 2011. Nevertheless, its focus is on contemporary Syria between March, 2011 and May, 2014. Geographically, its particular attention and in-depth analysis is on three areas in the non-government-controlled parts: Al-Raqqa (the city), Deir Ez-zor (Al-Mayadeen and the city) and Aleppo (the city).},

The growing knowledge on mediators and triggered pathways has advanced our understanding of the interactions along the gut-brain axis. Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, plasticity and behavior. Furthermore, intestinal microorganisms impact the host's metabolism and immune status which in turn affect neuronal pathways in the enteric and central nervous systems. Here, we discuss the recent insights from human studies and animal models on the bi-directional communication along the microbiome-gut-brain axis in both acute and chronic brain diseases.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate potential associations between persistent allergic symptoms in children, which have increased markedly in developed countries over the past three decades, and the concentration of phthalates in dust collected from their homes. This investigation is a case-control study nested within a cohort of 10,852 children. From the cohort, we selected 198 cases with persistent allergic symptoms and 202 controls without allergic symptoms. A clinical and a technical team investigated each child and her or his environment. We found higher median concentrations of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP) in dust among cases than among controls (0.15 vs. 0.12 mg/g dust). Analyzing the case group by symptoms showed that BBzP was associated with rhinitis (p = 0.001) and eczema (p = 0.001), whereas di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was associated with asthma (p = 0.022). Furthermore, dose-response relationships for these associations are supported by trend analyses. This study shows that phthalates, within the range of what is normally found in indoor environments, are associated with allergic symptoms in children. We believe that the different associations of symptoms for the three major phthalates - BBzP, DEHP, and di-n-butyl phthalate - can be explained by a combination of chemical physical properties and toxicologic potential. Given the phthalate exposures of children worldwide, the results from this study of Swedish children have global implications.},

	abstract     = {The long term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) record provides a critical historical perspective on vegetation dynamics necessary for global change research. Despite the proliferation of new sources of global, moderate resolution vegetation datasets, the remote sensing community is still struggling to create datasets derived from multiple sensors that allow the simultaneous use of spectral vegetation for time series analysis. To overcome the non-stationary aspect of NDVI, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to map the NDVI indices from AVHRR to those from MODIS using atmospheric, surface type and sensor-specific inputs to account for the differences between the sensors. The NDVI dynamics and range of MODIS NDVI data at 1 is matched and extended through the AVHRR record. Four years of overlap between the two sensors is used to train a neural network to remove atmospheric and sensor specific effects on the AVHRR NDVI. In this paper, we present the resulting continuous dataset, its relationship to MODIS data, and a validation of the product.},

	abstract     = {This study investigated the role of nocturnal melatonin secretion in the cognitive performance of diurnal animals. An initial experiment measured the cognitive performance in Indian house crows treated for 11 days with 12 h light at 1.426 W/m2 (∼150 lux) coupled with 12 h of 0.058 W/m2 (∼6-lux) dim light at night (dLAN) or with absolute darkness (0 lux dark night, LD). dLAN treatment significantly decreased midnight melatonin levels and negatively impacted cognitive performance. Subsequently, the role of exogenous melatonin (50 $\mu$g; administered intraperitoneally half an hour before the night began) was assessed on the regulation of cognitive performance in two separate experimental cohorts of crows kept under dLAN; LD controls received vehicle. Exogenous melatonin restored its mid-night levels under dLAN at par with those under LD controls, and improved the cognitive performance, as measured in the innovative problem-solving, and spatial and pattern learning-memory efficiency tests in dLAN-treated crows. There were concurrent molecular changes in the cognition-associated brain areas, namely the hippocampus, nidopallium caudolaterale and midbrain. In particular, the expression levels of genes involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (bdnf, dcx, egr1, creb), and dopamine synthesis and signalling (th, drd1, drd2, darpp32, taar1) were restored to LD control levels in crows treated with illuminated nights and received melatonin. These results demonstrate that the maintenance of nocturnal melatonin levels is crucial for an optimal higher-order brain function in diurnal animals in the face of an environmental threat, such as light pollution.},

	abstract     = {While fuel combustion in oxygen-enriched environments provides a number of significant advantages, such as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions and high carbon dioxide purity for carbon sequestration, it is characterized by different physico-chemical oxidation behavior than combustion in air. Compared to nitrogen, carbon dioxide has different specific heat and effective Lewis number, and is chemically more active. Therefore, chemical mechanisms developed for the oxidation of fuel/air mixtures can fail to predict targets of interest for oxy-combustion accurately. In this study, a chemical mechanism of methane, which has been previously validated with data from experiments using air, is evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy at oxy-conditions by comparing against available literature data. The validation takes various combustion properties into account, including ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities, and extinction strain rates, and covers a wide range of experimental conditions with respect to temperature, pressure, equivalence ratio, and carbon dioxide concentration. As additional targets, extinction strain rates of non-premixed oxy-methane flames are determined in a counterflow burner at conditions, where literature data have not yet been reported. The extensive validation demonstrates that the mechanism is able to describe oxy-methane combustion with reasonable prediction accuracy. For further insights into the underlying kinetics of diffusion flames of methane in oxy-atmosphere compared to its oxidation in air, reaction path and sensitivity analyses are performed using the validated mechanism. Notable differences between both combustion regimes are observed in the branching ratios of H-abstraction reactions by OH and H radicals and in the consumption channels of singlet methylene, which is a key species in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

Indoor air chemistry has many similarities to, but also some differences from, that in the ambient atmosphere. Indoors, there is less light, more available surface area and a time scale for reaction that is limited by the exchange rate with outdoors. Despite these differences, there is still a wide range of gas-phase and surface reactions and also partitioning between gas and particle phases. Consequently, indoor chemical reactions produce a myriad of complex, multifunctional products, many of which are thought to be harmful to health. Most research in this area has been focused on the reactions between ozone and terpene species. Ozone can ingress from outdoors, whereas terpenes are components of many indoor products such as cleaning fluids, air fresheners and fragrances. These reactions lead to a wide range of both short- and longer-lived species. Research is becoming increasingly focused on the impact of human activities such as cooking and cleaning on indoor air chemistry. The importance of surfaces is also becoming apparent, both in terms of providing a permanent or temporary sink for species that undergo deposition, but also as a means of forming new products.},

	abstract     = {There is growing concern about health effects of high air pollution in less-developed countries. Children represent a population at increased risk for air pollution–related respiratory conditions. This study investigated the relationship between high ambient air pollution exposure and respiratory health of young schoolchildren. From 2014 to 2016 in Jinan, China, 2532 primary school children in grades three to five from two different schools with different levels of air pollution were included in the study. Levels of ambient air pollution exposure including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO and O3 were measured continuously at the two schools. A questionnaire about children's respiratory health was conducted every year. Among them, about 150 randomly selected children also performed lung function tests two times a year at the beginning of November and middle of December. Annual average exposure levels of PM2.5 (66.8–79.1 vs 90.0–107.7 $\mu$g/m3), PM10 (129.5–177.3 vs 198.1–218.6 $\mu$g/m3), NO2 (45.3–53.2 vs 45.0–56.2 $\mu$g/m3), SO2 (29.8–56.5 vs 40.5–80.3 $\mu$g/m3), CO (1.3–1.5 vs 1.4–1.7 mg/m3) and O3 (84.8–120.2 vs 61.1–128.1 $\mu$g/m3) in the heavy pollution primary school were significantly higher than the light one. The higher air pollution exposure was related to increased prevalence of respiratory diseases of young children in the last year, especially allergic rhinitis. The increased odds of lung function impairment associated with exposure to higher air pollution, could be up to 171.5% (aOR = 2.715; 95% CI = 1.915–3.849) for PEF < 75% predicted in 2014. However, after short-term exposure for 1.5 month or a week, paired comparison for parameters of the same child showed different results. The association between high ambient air pollution exposure and respiratory health of young children is closely related to exposure time and dose and may be fluctuate and complex.},

However, within a given year, birds must rely upon proximate environmental information such as photoperiod, food, temperature, social cues and other factors to anticipate when that window will occur and prepare physiologically for breeding. While avian responses to photoperiod are relatively well understood, less is known about how birds use non-photoperiodic information in reproductive timing decisions – even though understanding how birds use non-photic cues is an important component of predicting their responses to global change. We review research on the regulation of reproductive physiology and clutch initiation by non-photic cues within and across avian species. We evaluate hypotheses in the literature about the integration of photoperiodic and non-photic cues in reproductive timing and about differences in non-photic cue-use between the sexes and across species. We show how regulation of reproduction by non-photic cues may influence species' responses to climate change and highlight research opportunities moving forward.},

Consequently, bioaerosol abundance and biodiversity can be underestimated, making it more difficult to link specific bioaerosol components to diseases and human health risk. Owing to the low biomass in air samples, it remains a challenge to obtain a representative microbiological sample to recover sufficient DNA for downstream analyses. Improved sampling methods are particularly crucial, especially for investigating viral communities, owing to the extremely low biomass of viral particles in the air compared with other environments. Without detailed information about sampling, characterization and enumeration techniques, interpretation of exposure level is very difficult. Despite this, bioaerosol research has been enhanced by molecular tools, especially next-generation sequencing approaches that have allowed faster and more detailed characterization of air samples.},

Increased costs have prompted energy conservation and more stringent operational standards for buildings. Tight building envelopes reduce energy losses, but force reassessment of building designs and retrofits. The paradigm has shifted from "ventilation" to "comfort" to "indoor environmental quality" (IEQ). Various air treatment technologies can be used for control of trace contaminants. Conventional processes, such as sorption, filtration, and disinfection, are combined with advanced treatment processes (ATP), such as photocatalytic oxidation to oxidize volatile organic compounds (VOCs), bipolar air ionization to agglomerate particulate matter (PMx), and ultraviolet disinfection to inactivate bioaerosols. Modular hybrid devices are integrated into engineered systems to control low levels of these contaminants. The extensive early development of these technologies is supplemented with improved diagnostic techniques applied to domestic, institutional, and commercial installations. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC Canada.},

Therefore, it is critical to characterize exposures to air pollution in indoor environments in order to conduct risk and health impact assessments. Not all indoor environments are the same, hence their contributions to personal exposure will differ. This chapter discusses different factors that might affect exposure to air pollution indoors, including time spent indoors, the influence of outdoor air and the presence of indoor sources of pollution. These factors are also influenced by human, societal and environmental characteristics, e.g. gender, age, employment status and lifestyle. Geopolitics will also influence the contribution of indoor exposures to total exposure, since the economic development of countries affects housing stock, access to energy, employment opportunities and transport infrastructure, all relevant to exposure. Regional climatological conditions will also affect indoor and total exposure to air pollution. This chapter describes the methodology for determining the contribution of indoor environments to total exposure and doses of air pollution. Factors relevant to exposure in indoor environments are discussed, including exposures in developing countries and for sensitive populations.},

We report field measurements of rBC dry and wet deposition rates during summer 2017 at the Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma. On average, dry deposition of rBC is 0.3 ± 0.2 mm/s. We estimate a wet deposition flux of 2,600 ng{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}hr−1 over the 148.5 mm of rainfall observed. These data indicate a composite lifetime of 7–11 days.},

Presented early in the book is theory as support for the applications that follow; including a synthesized review of the significant literature on controlling air pollution. Practical applications-largely from the author's own experience-deal with 1) How to conduct indoor air quality investigations in both residences and public access buildings, 2) Indoor air quality mitigation practice, and 3) Case histories. This book will be very useful to consultants and other professionals who grapple to solve real world problems. And it will make an excellent textbook for new courses in indoor air quality. Indoor Air Pollution Control will be used for control and prevention of contaminated air in homes, apartment buildings, office buildings (large and small), hospitals, auditoriums, and other public buildings.}

	abstract     = {Indoor air quality (IAQ) is one of the main topics in which governments are focusing. In healthcare facilities, several studies have reported data analysis and case studies to improve users' health. Nowadays, although many studies have been conducted related to the biological and physical risks, the chemical risks have been less investigated and only in some specific functional areas of the hospitals. Starting from some systematic reviews and research works, this paper aims to list the best healthy practices for an adequate IAQ in inpatient wards. In particular, the decalogue lists the strategies related to chemical pollution, starting from design and management, with a focus on (a) localization of hospitals and inpatient rooms, (b) hospital room, (c) microclimatic parameters, (d) ventilation systems, (e) materials and finishing, (f) furniture and equipment, (g) cleaning products and activities, (h) maintenance and (i) management activities, and (l) users and workers. The multidisciplinary approach emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and skills aimed to find solutions able to protect users' health status. The design and management decision-making, ranging from the adequate choices of construction site and hospital exposure, finishing materials, cleaning and maintenance activities, etc., which can affect the IAQ must be carried out based on scientific research and data analysis.},

Here, we investigated the occurrence, chemical composition, shape, and size of MPs in aircraft sampling campaigns flying within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). The results showed that MPs were present with concentrations ranging from 1.5 MPs m−3 above rural areas to 13.9 MPs m−3 above urban areas. MPs represented up to almost one third of the total amount of microparticles collected. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy allowed identifying seven types of MPs with the highest diversity corresponding to urban areas. Atmospheric transport and deposition simulations were performed using the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Air mass trajectory analyses showed that MPs could be transported more than 1000 km before being deposited. This pioneer study is the first evidence of the microplastic presence above PBL and their potential long-range transport from their point of release even crossing distant borders.},

	abstract     = {Objective: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) adversely affect human health. Our objective was to determine the association of EDC exposure with earlier age of menopause. Methods: Cross-sectional survey using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2008 (n = 31,575 females).Eligible participants included: menopausal women >30 years of age; not currently pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormonal contraception; no history of bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy. Exposures, defined by serum lipid and urine creatinine-adjusted measures of EDCs, data were analyzed: > 90th percentile of the EDC distribution among all women, log-transformed EDC level, and decile of EDC level. Multi linear regression models considered complex survey design characteristics and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, body mass index. EDCs were stratified into long (>1 year), short, and unknown half-lives; principle analyses were performed on those with long half-lives as well as phthalates, known reproductive toxicants. Secondary analysis determined whether the odds of being menopausal increased with EDC exposure among women aged 45-55 years. Findings: This analysis examined 111 EDCs and focused on known reproductive toxicants or chemicals with half-lives >1 year. Women with high levels of $\beta$-hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex, p,p′-DDE, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners -70, -99, -105, -118, -138, -153, -156, -170, and -183 had mean ages of menopause 1.9 to 3.8 years earlier than women with lower levels of these chemicals. EDC-exposed women were up to 6 times more likely to be menopausal than non-exposed women. Conclusions: This study of a representative sample of US women documents an association between EDCs and earlier age at menopause.

In this study, we measured concentrations and profiles of 9 phthalate esters in indoor dust samples collected from six cities in China (n = 75). For comparison, we also analyzed samples collected from Albany, New York, USA (n = 33). The results indicated that concentrations, except for dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and profiles of phthalate esters varied significantly between the two countries. Concentrations of diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-hexyl phthalate (DNHP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BzBP) were 5 to 10 times higher in dust samples collected from Albany than those from the Chinese cities. In contrast, concentrations of di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP) in dust samples from Albany were 5 times lower than those from the Chinese cities. We estimated the daily intake (DI) of phthalate esters through the routes of dust ingestion and dermal dust absorption. The extent of contribution of indoor dust to human exposures varied, depending on the type of phthalate esters. The contribution of dust to DEHP exposure was 2-5% and 10-58% of the estimated total DIs in China and the USA, respectively. On the basis of the estimates of total DIs of phthalates, extrapolated from urinary metabolite concentrations, the contributions of inhalation, dermal absorption, and dietary intake to total DIs were estimated. The results indicated that dietary intake is the main source of exposure to DEHP (especially in China), whereas dermal exposure was a major source for DEP. This is the first study to elucidate sources of human exposure to phthalates among the general population in China. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

For the most active working age population, the fraction of time spent indoors is around 85%, whereas for small children and the sedentary elderly the figure approaches 100%. Indoor air is, of course, particularly affected by indoor sources. Nevertheless, outdoor air is a significant contributor to indoor levels of the main classical air pollutants such as ultrafine and fine particles and nitrogen oxides, and often the only source of others such as ozone and sulfur dioxide. Indoor air quality is created by complex processes that involve outdoor air, ventilation, building tightness, filtration, mixtures of pollution, occupant behaviour and indoor emission sources ranging through building materials, soil, occupants, and customer products and appliances used in the building. The literature shows convincingly that the role played by outdoor air is probably the most significant single factor at the population level. In developed countries, the building stock is relatively well insulated, affecting the air exchange rates and infiltration processes. This chapter presents an overview of recent evidence on infiltration rates of outdoor air pollution and processes that affect them.},

The field is sustained by charge generation in distant disturbed weather regions, through current flow in the global electric circuit. Conventionally, the fair-weather part of the global circuit has disregarded clouds, but extensive layer clouds, important to climate, are widespread globally. Such clouds are not electrically inert, becoming charged at their upper and lower horizontal boundaries from vertical current flow, in a new electrical regime - neither fair nor disturbed weather; hence it is described here as semi-fair weather. Calculations and measurements show the upper cloud boundary charge is usually positive, the cloud interior positive and the lower cloud boundary negative, with the upper charge density larger, but of the same magnitude (∼nC m -2) as cloud base. Globally, the total positive charge stored by layer clouds is approximately 10 5 C, which, combined with the positive charge in the atmospheric column above the cloud up to the ionosphere, balances the total negative surface charge of the fair-weather regions. Extensive layer clouds are, therefore, an intrinsic aspect of the global circuit, and the resulting natural charging of their cloud droplets is a fundamental atmospheric feature.},

Aerosol is generated by the ozonolysis reaction of monoterpenes ($\alpha$-pinene, $\beta$-pinene, 3-carene, and limonene) and sesquiterpenes ($\beta$-caryophyllene, $\alpha$-humulene, and $\alpha$-cedrene) in a 10 m3 temperature-controlled Teflon smog chamber. In some cases, a self-seeding technique is used, which enables high particle concentrations with the desired diameters without compromising particle composition and purity. The monoterpene SOA is excellent CCN material, and it activates similarly (average activation diameter equals 48 ± 8 nm at 1% supersaturation for the species used in this work) to highly water-soluble organic species. Its effective solubility in water was estimated to be in the range of 0.07-0.40 g solute/g H2O. CCN measurements for sesquiterpene SOA (average activation diameter equals 120 ± 20 nm at 1% supersaturation for the species used in this work) show that it is less CCN active than monoterpene SOA. The initial terpene mixing ratio (between 3 and 100 ppb) does not affect the CCN activation for freshly generated SOA. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Carbonyl compounds are the crucial intermediate species for the autocatalytic production of OH. For example, in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere it is calculated based on data assimilation analysis of Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy Experiment (ATTMOS) data that CH3 production due to the degradation of carbonyls contributes around 40% to the overall production of CH3, a key initiation step for HOx production, with the contribution due to the photolysis of CH3CHO being comparable to that of acetone. So correctly modeling the alkyl radical concentrations is of central importance and has not be given the attention it deserves to date. The reactions of carbonyls with Br and Cl are also major sources of HBr and HCl. In short, carbonyl compounds play a central role in atmospheric chemistry close to the tropopause, and this is directly relevant to issues such as the assessment of the impact of air traffic, and ozone depletion.},

The goal of the chemistry data assimilation is to combine an atmospheric-chemistry model and actual observations to produce the best estimate of the chemistry of the atmosphere. The observational dataset collected during the past decades is an unprecedented expansion of our knowledge of the atmosphere. The exploitation of these data is the best way to advance our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, and to develop chemistry models for chemistry-climate prediction. The assimilation focuses on estimating the state of the chemistry in a chemically and dynamically consistent manner (if the model allows online interactions between chemistry and dynamics). In so doing, we can: produce simultaneous and chemically consistent estimates of all species (including model parameters), observed and unobserved; fill in data voids; test the photochemical theories used in the chemistry models. In this paper, the Hilbert space is first formulated from the geometric structure of the Banach space, followed by the development of the adjoint operator in Hilbert space. The principle of the adjoint method is described, followed by two examples which show the relationship of the gradient of the cost function with respect to the Output vector and the gradient of the cost function with respect to the input vector. Applications to chemistry data assimilation are presented for both continuous and discrete cases. The 4D data variational adjoint method is then tested in the assimilation of stratospheric chemistry using a simple catalytic ozone-destruction mechanism, and the test results indicate that the performance of the assimilation method is good.}

In this study a neural network using Quickprop learning and one hidden layer with eight nodes was able to reproduce the CH4-N2O correlation with a correlation coefficient between simulated and training values of 0.9995. Such an accurate representation of tracer-tracer correlations allows more use to be made of long-term datasets to constrain chemical models.

Between 1998 and 2004 the stratospheric loading of HCl was relatively constant, with some month to month fluctuation; this was followed by a more pronounced decrease in HCl since 2004. We use probability distribution functions ( PDFs) and scatter diagrams for validation and bias characterization of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder ( MLS) HCl retrievals. Both these methods allow us to use large statistical samples and do not require correlative measurements to be colocated in space and time. The bias between the Halogen Occultation Experiment ( HALOE) and Aura MLS is greatest above the 525 K ( similar to 21 km) isentropic surface. The global average mean bias between Aura and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE) for January 2005 was 2% and between Aura MLS and HALOE was 14%. The widths of the PDFs are a measure of the spatial variability and measurement precision. The Aura MLS HCl PDFs are consistently wider than those for ACE and HALOE, this reflects the retrieval uncertainties. The median observation uncertainty for Aura MLS v1.51 HCl is 12%, and the median ACE v2.2 uncertainty is 8%. We also connect Aura MLS HCl with the heritage of HALOE HCl by using neural networks to learn the interinstrument biases and provide a seamless HCl record from the launch of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS) in 1991 to the present.},

	abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) radiative-dynamical-chemical model has been developed and used to study the evolution of trace gases in the Arctic lower stratosphere during winter 1989-1990. A series of 10-day model integrations were performed throughout this period. The model includes a comprehensive scheme of gas phase chemical reactions as well as a parameterization of heterogeneous reactions occurring on polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) surfaces. An important element of a 3D chemical model is the transport scheme. In this study the transport of chemical species is achieved by a non diffusive method well suited to the preservation of sharp gradients. During the winter studied temperatures were cold enough for the formation of both type I and type II polar stratospheric clouds from early December to early February. Model simulations in late December show that inside the polar vortex air is rapidly processed by polar stratospheric clouds converting HCl and ClONO2 to active chlorine. The possibility of ozone destruction depends strongly on the amount of sunlight. In early February an average ozone loss of 15 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) /day is predicted in PSC-processed air at 50 hPa. giving a column loss of just under 1 DU/day. This loss increases to 25 ppbv/day if PSCs persist until March with a column loss of around 1.5 DU/day. The relatively small magnitude of the ozone loss predicted in the model, compared to the variability of ozone induced by dynamics, highlights the problems in identifying the signature of chemical ozone loss in the Arctic. In future years significant ozone depletion could occur if PSCs persist until late March. rhe efficiency of the catalytic cycles responsible for the ozone loss has been analyzed as a function of latitude, altitude and time. In general, the cycle involving ClO + ClO is the dominant loss mechanism in the polar lower stratosphere. Cycles involving BrO can make a relatively large contribution early in the season and when the levels of CIO are low. The cycle initiated by ClO + O destroys ozone at altitudes above 30 hPa but the loss is compensated, to some extent, by in situ ozone production. The results for trace species are validated, where possible, by comparison with the available measurements, although the sparse nature of the observations does not effectively constrain the model.},

Since a detailed treatment of all processes involved is time consuming, many approximations are usually made. An approximation used in virtually all GCM radiation codes that extend into the middle atmosphere is that the atmosphere can be treated as plane parallel. This approximation breaks down when the sun is close to the horizon and does not apply for large solar zenith angles. This paper shows that this approximation leads to a very serious underestimate of solar heating rates in the polar regions. Ignoring spherical effects, and in particular the heating due to absorption at zenith angles greater than 90-degrees, gives rise to a very different latitudinal gradient in the diurnally averaged heating rates calculated at the equinox. Such a change in the latitudinal gradient in the heating rate is of significance for the general circulation. Accounting for the heating that occurs at zenith angles greater than 90-degrees is shown to be important.},

We have considered reactions on both sulfate aerosols and on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), It is shown that the hydrolysis of BrONO2 on sulfate aerosols enhances the HOBr concentration, which in turn enhances the OH and HO2 concentrations, thereby reducing the HCl lifetime and concentration. The hydrolysis of BrONO2 leads to a nighttime production of HOBr, making HOBr a major nighttime bromine reservoir. The photolysis of HOBr gives a rapid increase in the OH and HO2 concentration at dawn, as was recently observed by Salawitch et al. {[}1994]. The increase in the OH and HO2 concentration, and the decrease in the HCl concentration, leads to additional ozone depletion at all latitudes and for all season. At temperatures below 210 K the bulk phase reaction of HOBr with HCl in sulfate aerosols becomes important. The most important heterogeneous bromine reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are the mixed halogen reactions of HCl with HOBr and BrONO2 and of HBr with HOCl and ClONO2.},

This technique involves integrating a photochemical package along a large number of independent trajectories to produce a Lagrangian view of the atmosphere. Although Lagrangian chemical modeling with trajectories is an established procedure, this extension of integrating chemistry along a large number of domain-filling trajectories is a novel technique. This technique is complementary to three-dimensional Eulerian chemical transport modeling and avoids spurious mixing caused by low resolutions or diffusive transport schemes in these models. We illustrate the technique by studying the chlorine activation in the Arctic winter lower stratosphere. A photochemical model was integrated along large ensembles of calculated trajectories between 20 and 100 mbar for the 1991/1992 winter in order to produce a three-dimensional chemical picture. Large amounts of chlorine was activated at low altitudes (80 to 100 mbar) as well as altitudes near 50 mbar. This activated air was well contained at all levels, with little indication of mixing into lower latitudes. Model results for early January 1992 were compared to daily Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) ClO observations at 465 K. The structure and evolution of the activated chlorine was well reproduced, giving faith in the technique, although absolute modeled ClO amounts were smaller than the MLS data. A larger number of domain-filling isentropic trajectories were also run at 475 K to produce a higher-resolution picture of vortex evolution in late January 1992. The model successfully reproduced the wave breaking events which characterized this period causing transport of activated air to lower latitudes.},

This is because the two differential equations solved numerically by DeMajistre et al. have been which reduced them to only one simple expression. The effects of refraction on stratospheric chemistry calculated with this new model are shown to be greatest in the polar lower stratosphere close to the onset and completion of polar night. The main effect is to change the shape of the seasonal cycle of reactive species produced by photolysis such as NO, NO2, OH, HO2, Cl, ClO, Br, and BrO during the onset and completion of polar night.}

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM) with 25 × 25 km2 resolution over North America is used as a common platform to interpret measurements of different aerosol variables made at different times and locations. Sulfate and organic aerosol (OA) are the main contributors to surface PM2.5 (mass concentration of PM finer than 2.5 $\mu$m aerodynamic diameter) and AOD over the southeast US. OA is simulated successfully with a simple parameterization, assuming irreversible uptake of low-volatility products of hydrocarbon oxidation. Biogenic isoprene and monoterpenes account for 60 % of OA, anthropogenic sources for 30 %, and open fires for 10 %. 60 % of total aerosol mass is in the mixed layer below 1.5 km, 25 % in the cloud convective layer at 1.5-3 km, and 15 % in the free troposphere above 3 km. This vertical profile is well captured by GEOS-Chem, arguing against a high-altitude source of OA. The extent of sulfate neutralization (f = [NH<inf>4</inf><sup>+</sup>]/(2[SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2-</sup>] + [NO<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup>]) is only 0.5-0.7 mol mol<sup>-1</sup> in the observations, despite an excess of ammonia present, which could reflect suppression of ammonia uptake by OA. This would explain the long-term decline of ammonium aerosol in the southeast US, paralleling that of sulfate. The vertical profile of aerosol extinction over the southeast US follows closely that of aerosol mass. GEOS-Chem reproduces observed total column aerosol mass over the southeast US within 6 %, column aerosol extinction within 16 %, and space-based AOD within 8-28 % (consistently biased low). The large AOD decline observed from summer to winter is driven by sharp declines in both sulfate and OA from August to October. These declines are due to shutdowns in both biogenic emissions and UV-driven photochemistry. Surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> shows far less summer-to-winter decrease than AOD and we attribute this in part to the offsetting effect of weaker boundary layer ventilation. The SEAC4RS aircraft data demonstrate that AODs measured from space are consistent with surface PM<inf>2.5</inf>. This implies that satellites can be used reliably to infer surface PM<inf>2.5</inf> over monthly timescales if a good CTM representation of the aerosol vertical profile is available.},

	abstract     = {Only few studies investigated the input of microplastic particles via the atmosphere, so far. Here, we present results on microplastic concentrations in the atmospheric deposition in the metropolitan region of Hamburg. In total, six investigation sites were equipped with three bulk precipitation samplers each and sampled biweekly over 12 weeks (12/17–03/18). Three sites were located in a rural area south of Hamburg comprising one open field site and two throughfall sites under beech/oak and Douglas fir forest canopy, respectively. Three further sites were selected within the city following a transect from north to south representing urban sites of varying degrees concerning population, traffic and industrial pressures. Particles and fibers were counted under UV light within a photo box and under a fluorescence microscope (Axio Lab A.1, Zeiss). Results show that microplastic particles are ubiquitous at all sites. A median abundance between 136.5 and 512.0 microplastic particles per m2/day has been found over the sampling period. This equals a mean microplastic abundance of 275 particles/m2/day $\mu$Raman spectroscopy showed that polyethylenes/ethylvinyl acetate copolymers are dominating significantly (48.8 and 22.0%, respectively), 16 particles analyzed (14.6%)were identified as contamination from PE (polyethylene)samplers. In contrast to other studies, fragments were significantly dominating compared to fibers. The spatial distribution comparing the urban sites concentrations followed in the order from high to low: “north” (Henstedt-Ulzburg, low population density, suburb)– “center” (University; large population density)– “south” (Wilhelmsburg, middle population density, port and industrial facilities)with highly varying concentrations within the time series. Surprisingly, the rural sites in the southern part of Hamburg showed highest concentrations (Douglas fir > open field > beech/oak). This finding is most likely a result of factors such as the comb out capacity of the different forest types and/or direct input pathways from the agricultural areas and the nearby highway.},

	abstract     = {This paper highlights the importance of halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The calculated rate of methane oxidation is increased by at least 20% in the upper troposphere when halogen catalysis is included. In the lower stratosphere, approximately 25% of methane oxidation can be initiated by chlorine; the precise fraction is very temperature dependent. Including halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation increases the HOx and ClOx concentrations and decreases the NOx concentration. The calculated enhancement in the HOx concentration due to halogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is around 10-15% in the lower stratosphere; and around 20% in the upper troposphere. The decrease in the NOx concentration is around 10% in the upper troposphere. The enhancement in the ClOx concentration is around 7-10% in the lower stratosphere. The increase in the calculated HOx and ClOx concentrations and the decrease in the NOx concentration lead to a enhancement in the calculated O-3 loss. The additional O-3 loss calculated is most significant in the upper troposphere where over a 7-day simulation it was of the order of 0.1-1% for midlatitudes at equinox. As the atmospheric loading of chlorine drops the gross odd-oxygen production by NO + HO2 will increase, so there will be an accelerated ozone recovery. On a per molecule basis, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is approximately 2 orders of magnitude faster than chlorine catalyzed methane oxidation. In the upper troposphere bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation destroys ozone at a rate which is approximately one: third of that at which nitrogen-catalyzed methane oxidation is producing ozone. Therefore, with the increasing atmospheric bromine loading, bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation is set to become more important. It would be valuable to have kinetic studies of the reaction BrO with CH3O2 so that the role of bromine-catalyzed methane oxidation can be quantified more precisely.},

Phthalates, especially dimethyl phthalate, are known to react with criteria air pollutants contributing to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. This study investigated phthalates levels in the atmosphere in Shanghai with a focus on their associations with different air quality weather events. The air quality during the study period was classified into three levels: non-haze, light pollution and moderate pollution. Phthalates levels were found to be lower in non-haze weather events (236 ng/m3) and higher in moderate pollution weather events (up to 700 ng/m3). Meteorological factors of relative humidity and wind speed had an inverse relationship with phthalates levels. Particulate matter had a positive correlation with phthalates levels. Hydroxyl radical initiated photo-reaction of dimethyl phthalate was evident by its inverse relationship with total atmospheric oxidant (O3 + NO2), indicating that dimethyl phthalate could be one of the precursors of secondary organic aerosol causing haze weather events. Daily intake of phthalates through exposure to outdoor air is estimated to be relatively minor; children intake remains higher on a body weight basis. This is the first study demonstrating the relationship of phthalates and different air quality conditions in haze weather events. The knowledge contributes to our understanding on the cause of haze weather events in China and elsewhere.},

	abstract     = {Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is the termination of pregnancies, usually before 20 weeks of gestation, and is defined as the loss of two or more pregnancies. In Taiwan, after 2011 di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure episode, more reproductive-aged women still expose to high levels of DEHP and di-butyl phthalate (DBP) than have women of other age groups. Phthalates might be involved in the RPL pathogenesis. This study assessed the association of phthalate exposure with RPL risk in reproductive-aged Taiwanese women. This study recruited 103 patients diagnosed by a physician with RPL of unknown etiology and 76 controls from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a medical center in southern Taiwan between August 2013 and August 2017. Urine samples were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites through liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry; subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis were performed to determine the main sources of phthalate exposure. Finally, multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the RPL risk. The creatinine-unadjusted median levels of mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) in RPL/control were 9.8/5.3, 27.2/13.1, 11.4/8.1, and 12.9/9.5 ng/mL, respectively; furthermore, $\Sigma$DBPm and $\Sigma$DEHPm in RPL/control were 0.18/0.10 and 0.15/0.12 nmol/mL, respectively. PCA revealed three primary components of phthalate exposure: diethyl phthalates (DEP), DEHP, and DBP. Plastic food container use and medication were identified as the main phthalate exposure sources. After adjustment for potential confounding factors (urinary creatinine, age, age at menarche, education, and plastic food container use), we found that the urinary level of $\Sigma$DBPm was significantly associated with elevated risk for RPL (OR = 2.85, p = 0.045). Our findings supported the hypothesis that exposure to phthalates increases RPL risk. The development of a strategy to reduce phthalate exposure among reproductive-aged women should be emphasized. Phthalates exposure increase the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss.},

	abstract     = {Volatile organic compounds emitted by plants represent the largest part of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) released into our atmosphere. Plant volatiles are formed through many biochemical pathways, constitutively and after stress induction. In recent years, our understanding of the functions of these molecules has made constant and rapid progress. From being considered in the past as a mere waste of carbon, BVOCs have now emerged as an essential element of an invisible language that is perceived and exploited by the plants' enemies, the enemies of plant enemies, and neighbouring plants. In addition, BVOCs have important functions in protecting plants from abiotic stresses. Recent advances in our understanding of the role of BVOC in direct and indirect defences are driving further attention to these emissions. This special issue gathers some of the latest and most original research that further expands our knowledge of BVOC. BVOC emissions and functions in (1) unexplored terrestrial (including the soil) and marine environments, (2) in changing climate conditions, and (3) under anthropic pressures, or (4) in complex trophic communities are comprehensively reviewed. Stepping up from scientific awareness, the presented information shows that the manipulation and exploitation of BVOC is a realistic and promising strategy for agricultural applications and biotechnological exploitations. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

A simulation is conducted to encompass the growth and decay cycle of a supercell thunderstorm, with a focus on irreversible transport above the tropopause. Five previously published tropopause definitions are evaluated: World Meteorological Organization (WMO) temperature lapse rate, potential vorticity, static stability, vertical curvature of the Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency, and stratospheric tracer concentration. By analyzing the behavior of different definitions both during and after active convection, we are able to define ''best'' choices for tropopause definitions as those that return to states most closely matching the preconvective environment. Potential vorticity and stratospheric tracer concentration are shown to perform poorly when analyzing deep convection. The WMO thermal tropopause and static stability definitions are found to perform the best, providing similar tropopause placement and quantities of irreversible mass transport. This investigation highlights the challenges of defining a tropopause in the vicinity of deep convection and demonstrates the need to clearly communicate calculation methods and threshold choices in the literature.},

There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.},

These effects are found, largely, in developing countries where people, especially women and young children, are exposed to high concentrations of smoke produced by biomass burning for cooking. Approximately 3 million deaths occur each year. In developed countries, the problem is much less acute: accidental exposure to high concentrations of carbon monoxide is the main cause of death. It should be remembered, however, that much of people's exposure to pollutants generated outdoors occurs in the indoor environment. Indoor exposure to particulate matter has the same effects as outdoor exposure: the cardiovascular system is most affected, with deaths being due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Exposure to particulate matter may also contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, although perhaps not having a great effect on measures of lung function, may contribute to the development of emphysema and reduce the resistance of the body to bacterial and viral infections. Lung cancer, due to exposure to carcinogens in wood smoke, also occurs. Efforts to reduce levels of indoor air pollution in developing countries, for example by providing flued cooking stoves, have been shown to reduce the prevalence of disease.},

	abstract     = {Increasing both crop productivity and the tolerance of crops to abiotic and biotic stresses is a major challenge for global food security in our rapidly changing climate. For the first time, we show how the spatial variation and severity of tropospheric ozone effects on yield compare with effects of other stresses on a global scale, and discuss mitigating actions against the negative effects of ozone. We show that the sensitivity to ozone declines in the order soybean > wheat > maize > rice, with genotypic variation in response being most pronounced for soybean and rice. Based on stomatal uptake, we estimate that ozone (mean of 2010–2012) reduces global yield annually by 12.4%, 7.1%, 4.4% and 6.1% for soybean, wheat, rice and maize, respectively (the “ozone yield gaps”), adding up to 227 Tg of lost yield. Our modelling shows that the highest ozone-induced production losses for soybean are in North and South America whilst for wheat they are in India and China, for rice in parts of India, Bangladesh, China and Indonesia, and for maize in China and the United States. Crucially, we also show that the same areas are often also at risk of high losses from pests and diseases, heat stress and to a lesser extent aridity and nutrient stress. In a solution-focussed analysis of these results, we provide a crop ideotype with tolerance of multiple stresses (including ozone) and describe how ozone effects could be included in crop breeding programmes. We also discuss altered crop management approaches that could be applied to reduce ozone impacts in the shorter term. Given the severity of ozone effects on staple food crops in areas of the world that are also challenged by other stresses, we recommend increased attention to the benefits that could be gained from addressing the ozone yield gap.},

	abstract     = {Recent epidemics of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya have heightened the need to understand the seasonal and geographic range of transmission by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18–34°C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26–29°C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.},

	abstract     = {Almost all homes, apartments, and commercial buildings will experience\nleaks, flooding, or other forms of excessive indoor dampness at some point.\nNot only is excessive dampness a health problem by itself, it also contributes\nto several other potentially problematic types of situations. Molds and other\nmicrobial agents favor damp indoor environments, and excess moisture may\ninitiate the release of chemical emissions from damaged building materials\nand furnishings. This new book from the Institute of Medicine examines the\nhealth impact of exposures resulting from damp indoor environments and\noffers recommendations for public health interventions.\nDamp Indoor Spaces and Health covers a broad range of topics. The book\nnot only examines the relationship between damp or moldy indoor environments\nand adverse health outcomes but also discusses how and where\nbuildings get wet, how dampness influences microbial growth and chemical\nemissions, ways to prevent and remediate dampness, and elements of\na public health response to the issues. A comprehensive literature review\nfinds sufficient evidence of an association between damp indoor environments\nand some upper respiratory tract symptoms, coughing, wheezing,\nand asthma symptoms in sensitized persons. This important book will be of\ninterest to a wide-ranging audience of science, health, engineering, and\nbuilding professionals, government officials, and members of the public.}

Poor environmental conditions and indoor contaminants are estimated to cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars a year in exacerbation of illnesses like asthma, allergic symptoms, and subsequent lost productivity. Climate change has the potential to affect the indoor environment because conditions inside buildings are influenced by conditions outside them.\nClimate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health addresses the impacts that climate change may have on the indoor environment and the resulting health effects. It finds that steps taken to mitigate climate change may cause or exacerbate harmful indoor environmental conditions. The book discusses the role the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take in informing the public, health professionals, and those in the building industry about potential risks and what can be done to address them. The study also recommends that building codes account for climate change projections; that federal agencies join to develop or refine protocols and testing standards for evaluating emissions from materials, furnishings, and appliances used in buildings; and that building weatherization efforts include consideration of health effects.\nClimate Change, the Indoor Environment, and Health is written primarily for the EPA and other federal agencies, organizations, and researchers with interests in public health; the environment; building design, construction, and operation; and climate issues.}

	abstract     = {People spend the vast majority of their time inside their homes and other indoor environments where they are exposed to a wide range of chemicals from building materials, furnishings, occupants, cooking, consumer products, and other sources. Despite research to date, very little is known about how exposures to indoor chemicals across complex chemical phases and pathways affect human health. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased public awareness of indoor environments and shed light on the many outstanding questions about how best to manage chemicals indoors. This report identifies gaps in current research and understanding of indoor chemistry and new approaches that can be applied to measure, manage, and limit chemical exposures. Why Indoor Chemistry Matters calls for further research about the chemical transformations that can occur indoors, pathways and timing of indoor chemical exposure, and the cumulative and long-term impacts of exposure on human health. Research priorities should consider factors that contribute to measurable environmental health disparities that affect, vulnerable populations, such as the age, location, and condition of buildings that can alter exposures to indoor chemicals.}

The database contains photochemical data including absorption, fluorescence, photoelectron, and circular and linear dichroism spectra, as well as quantum yields and photolysis related data that are critically needed in many scientific disciplines. This manuscript gives an outline regarding the structure and content of the “science-softCon UV/Vis+ Photochemistry Database”. The accurate and reliable molecular level information provided in this database is fundamental in nature and helps in proceeding further to understand photon, electron and ion induced chemistry of molecules of interest not only in spectroscopy, astrochemistry, astrophysics, Earth and planetary sciences, environmental chemistry, plasma physics, combustion chemistry but also in applied fields such as medical diagnostics, pharmaceutical sciences, biochemistry, agriculture, and catalysis. In order to illustrate this, we illustrate the use of the UV/Vis+ Photochemistry Database in four different fields of scientific endeavor.},

As pollen and molds exhibit geographical variations, we sought to understand the impact of climate change (temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2), precipitation, smoke exposure) on common pollen and molds in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the largest urban areas in the United States. When using time-series regression models between 2002 and 2019, the annual average number of weeks with pollen concentrations higher than zero increased over time. For tree pollens, the average increase in this duration was 0.47 weeks and 0.51 weeks for mold spores. Associations between mold, pollen and meteorological data (e.g., precipitation, temperature, atmospheric CO2, and area covered by wildfire smoke) were analyzed using the autoregressive integrated moving average model. We found that peak concentrations of weed and tree pollens were positively associated with temperature (p < 0.05 at lag 0–1, 0–4, and 0–12 weeks) and precipitation (p < 0.05 at lag 0–4, 0–12, and 0–24 weeks) changes, respectively. We did not find clear associations between pollen concentrations and CO2 levels or wildfire smoke exposure. This study's findings suggest that spore and pollen activities are related to changes in observed climate change variables.},

Distinct curves form in the polar vortex, the midlatitude "surf zones", and the tropics. Theory predicts such relationships for sufficiently rapid mixing along isentropic surfaces. Model results are used to illustrate the formation and seasonal evolution of distinct tracer relationships in the different regions. Using such relationships to associate departures from canonical forms with anomalous chemical or microphysical behavior must be done with care and with full awareness of the meteorological context of the data. Although the theory has been developed in the context of stratospheric tracers, the key requirement is that transport is predominantly two-dimensional. While the theory is thus inappropriate in the troposphere, it should be applicable to transport in the ocean interior. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract     = {HVAC filters are commonly used to decrease exposure to particulate matter, yet little is known about the energy impacts and air quality consequences of high efficiency filters installed in commercial buildings. To explore these effects, system airflow, filter and coil pressure drop, fan pressure rise, and power draw were measured, and cooling capacity and compressor power were modeled for at least four filter pressure drops in 15 rooftop units equipped with and without fan speed control. Energy implications and clean-air-delivery-rate were estimated for a large dataset of filters divided into four efficiency (MERV) categories. Field measurements conducted on units without fan speed control showed that increased filter pressure drop decreased flow, cooling capacity, and power. For a unit with fan speed control, the same increase in pressure drop resulted in the same magnitude change of fan power but in the opposite direction, and other parameters were unchanged. Replacing MERV 8 with MERV 13/14 resulted in higher energy consumption (2–4%) during cooling mode for both unit types, energy savings during fan-only mode (8–13%) in units without fan speed control, and increased energy consumption in fan-only mode (11–18%) in the unit with fan speed control. Energy consumption increases were offset by improvement in clean-air-delivery-rate, especially for PM2.5 (2.9–3.8 times increase going from MERV 8 to MERV 13/14), with larger benefits achieved for the unit with fan speed control. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of filtration is essential to selecting the appropriate efficiency of filters that ensures low-energy use and a healthy indoor environment.}

There is a long list of indoor sources that can contribute to increased pollutant concentrations, some of them related to human activities (e.g. people's movement, cooking, cleaning, smoking), but also to surface chemistry reactions with human skin and building and furniture surfaces. The result of all these emissions is a heterogeneous cocktail of pollutants with varying degrees of toxicity, which makes indoor air quality a complex system. Good characterization of the sources that affect indoor air pollution levels is of major importance for quantifying (and reducing) the associated health risks. This chapter reviews some of the more significant indoor sources that can be found in the most common non-occupational indoor environments.},

The present paper deals with health aspects and complaints linked to the interaction between building, HVAC system, environment and occupant. HVAC-related factors are specially emphasized. In order to minimize the risk of complaints as much as possible, a number of recommendations or guidelines is given for each link in the building process, i.e. from design stage up to maintenance and manage ment. A quality assurance system for this building process is of utmost impor tance; therefore, policies and procedures have to be developed. {\textcopyright} 1993, Sage Publications.

	abstract     = {Because birds are conspicuous and easy to identify and count, reliable records of their occurrence have been gathered over many decades in many parts of the world. Drawing on such data for North America, Rosenberg et al. report wide-spread population declines of birds over the past half-century, resulting in the cumulative loss of billions of breeding individuals across a wide range of species and habitats. They show that declines are not restricted to rare and threatened species—those once considered common and wide-spread are also diminished. These results have major implications for ecosystem integrity, the conservation of wildlife more broadly, and policies associated with the protection of birds and native ecosystems on which they depend. Science, this issue p. 120 The cumulative loss of nearly 3 billion birds since 1970 across North American biomes signals a continuing avifaunal crisis. Species extinctions have defined the global biodiversity crisis, but extinction begins with loss in abundance of individuals that can result in compositional and functional changes of ecosystems. Using multiple and independent monitoring networks, we report population losses across much of the North American avifauna over 48 years, including once-common species and from most biomes. Integration of range-wide population trajectories and size estimates indicates a net loss approaching 3 billion birds, or 29\% of 1970 abundance. A continent-wide weather radar network also reveals a similarly steep decline in biomass passage of migrating birds over a recent 10-year period. This loss of bird abundance signals an urgent need to address threats to avert future avifaunal collapse and associated loss of ecosystem integrity, function, and services.}

	abstract     = {The most common airborne algae are recognized as a community of aeroalgae, and their morphological attributes and dimensions are associated to an average aerodynamic structure, called ideal airborne algae. The principal atmospheric factors producing the dispersion and viability of alga are briefly introduced. For the first time, in a systematic and consequent way, preprocessors of atmospheric parameters are used in aerobiology. The research indicates, at least statistically, that the synthesis of specific parameters in preprocessors is of a greater relevance for the dispersion of algae (and physically equivalent particles) than each one of the meteorological parameters by themselves. This synthesis introduces a theoretical - practical level of elaboration that allows a greater deepness of analysis. In this case, the adequate preprocessors of atmospheric movements are the turbulent kinetic energy and the evaporation. Another fundamental factor is the atmospheric pollution. In the southern metropolitan area of Mexico City the ozone represents an acceptable index of the levels of pollution limiting the viability of airborne algae. Under the assumption of a (steady) given supply of algae, a possible model of concentrations of algae in the atmosphere is constructed based on statistical considerations, aimed to predictions of those concentrations. {\textcopyright} 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract     = {Well-mixed atmospheric aqueous aerosol droplets containing multiple chemical species can undergo processes such as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and crystallization depending on the ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). So far, only a handful of single droplet studies have examined the effect of temperature in conjunction with the organic to inorganic ratio (OIR) on the separation RH for LLPS. In this work, we present a temperature-controlled microfluidic static trap approach to study the LLPS and efflorescence phenomenon in multiple ternary systems in a quasi-equilibrium manner. Ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride is used as the inorganic phase and 3-methylglutaric acid (3-MGA), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(propylene glycol), or poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate is used as the organic phase. Results show a clear trend in droplets containing 3-MGA with either salt of the initial LLPS and efflorescence events occurring at higher RH at lower temperatures, while this trend is less obvious for the other organics. The organic to inorganic ratio (OIR) of the system also affected the type of first phase transition, which can be either LLPS or efflorescence. Finally, the rate of RH change also had an impact on the temperature dependence of the formation of either anhydrous or dihydrous crystals of sodium chloride upon efflorescence. These results help inform the effects of temperature, OIR, and rate of RH change on the phase state of aqueous aerosol droplets containing multiple species.},

PM has been widely studied in the context of several diseases, and its role in lung carcinogenesis gained relevance due to an increase in cancer cases for which smoking does not seem to represent the main risk factor. According to epidemiological and toxicological evidence, PM acts as a carcinogenic factor in humans, inducing high rates of genomic alterations. Here, we discuss not only how PM is capable of inducing genomic instability during the carcinogenic process but also how our genetic background influences the response to the sources of damage.},

Analysis of seven soundings through strong updrafts of isolated supercell storms show that the basic E structure there has three |E| peaks: a positive peak near 8 km height, a negative peak near 10.5 km, and a positive peak near 12 km. Strong updraft soundings are those with average balloon ascent rates in excess of 10 m s-1. The basic charge structure in strong updrafts of supercells has four charge regions of alternating polarity. The lowermost charge is positive, between about 4 and 8 km, and the uppermost region is negative. All the supercell updraft soundings are incomplete due to balloon burst or lightning-induced instrument destruction below cloud top. Six supercell soundings that ascended outside strong updrafts are used to show that the E and charge structures there are more complex than within the strong updrafts. Analysis of 15 new or previously published soundings through small, New Mexican mountain thunderstorms indicates that the basic E structure in or near their convective cores consists of three |E| peaks: a lower positive peak at about 5 km height, a midlevel negative peak near 6.5 km, and an upper positive peak near 9.5 km. The basic charge structure near the center of New Mexican storm convection has four charge regions, alternating in polarity, with a positive charge region lowest. Soundings in New Mexican convection that did not ascend near the convective cores show more complex E profiles and charge structures. Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	abstract     = {Objectives Outdoor air pollution is a serious environmental problem worldwide. Current systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) mostly focused on some specific health outcomes or some specific air pollution. Design This evidence gap map (EGM) is to identify existing gaps from SRs and MAs and report them in broad topic areas. Data sources PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from their inception until June 2018. Citations and reference lists were traced. Eligibility criteria SRs and MAs that investigated the impact of outdoor air pollution on human health outcomes were collected. This study excluded original articles and qualitative review articles. Data extraction and synthesis Characteristics of the included SRs and MAs were extracted and summarised. Extracted data included authors, publication year, location of the corresponding author(s), publication journal discipline, study design, study duration, sample size, study region, target population, types of air pollution and health outcomes. Results Asia and North America published 93% of SRs and MAs included in this EGM. 31% of the SRs and MAs (27/86) included primary studies conducted in 5-10 countries. Their publication trends have increased during the last 10 years. A total of 2864 primary studies was included. The median number of included primary studies was 20 (range, 7-167). Cohort studies, case cross-over studies and time-series studies were the top three most used study designs. The mostly researched population was the group of all ages (46/86, 53%). Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and health service records were mostly reported. A lack of definite diagnostic criteria, unclear reporting of air pollution exposure and time period of primary studies were the main research gaps. Conclusions This EGM provided a visual overview of health outcomes affected by outdoor air pollution exposure. Future research should focus on chronic diseases, cancer and mental disorders.},

Due to the potential exposure to phthalates in office rooms, their concentrations in the air of these premises after their renovation and furnishing were determined. The aim of the study was to determine the content of these compounds in the gas phase and adsorbed on the particles. Thus, the combined sampler with filters and adsorption tube was used for air sampling. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS. The gas fraction was dominated by dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and the inhalable fraction by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and 2-(diethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). The total concentration of phthalates in the respirable fraction in the furnished rooms was as much as 92% of the phthalates determined in the inhalable fraction. In the rooms immediately after renovation and those arranged and used by employees for 7 months, their concentration in the respirable fraction did not exceed 25% of the phthalates in the inhalable fraction. Phthalate concentration in the renovated rooms after 7 months of their usage dropped by 84% in relation to PAEs concentration in newly arranged rooms and by 68% in relation to the phthalate concentration in empty rooms.},

	abstract     = {Background: The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified both outdoor air pollution and airborne particulate matter as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) for lung cancer. There may be associations with cancer at other sites; however, the epidemiological evidence is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify whether ambient air pollution is associated with specific types of cancer other than lung cancer by examining associations of ambient air pollution with nonlung cancer death in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II). Methods: Analysis included 623,048 CPS-II participants who were followed for 22 y (1982-2004). Modeled estimates of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) (1999-2004), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (2006), and ozone (O3) (2002-2004) concentrations were linked to the participant residence at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations per each fifth percentile-mean increment with cancer mortality at 29 anatomic sites, adjusted for individual and ecological covariates. Results: We observed 43,320 nonlung cancer deaths. PM2 5 was significantly positively associated with death from cancers of the kidney {adjusted hazard ratio (HR) per 4.4 $\mu$g/m3 = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.27]} and bladder [HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.23)]. NO2 was positively associated with colorectal cancer mortality [HR per 6.5ppb = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.10). The results were similar in two-pollutant models including PM2 5 and NO2 and in three-pollutant models with O3. We observed no statistically significant positive associations with death from other types of cancer based on results from adjusted models. Conclusions: The results from this large prospective study suggest that ambient air pollution was not associated with death from most nonlung cancers, but associations with kidney, bladder, and colorectal cancer death warrant further investigation.},

	abstract     = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> We have performed backward trajectory calculations and simulations with the 3-dimensional Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) for two succeeding monsoon seasons using artificial tracers of air mass origin. With these tracers we trace back the origin of young air masses (age<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>6 months) at the top of the Asian monsoon anticyclone and of air masses within the tropical pipe (6 months<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>age<span class="thinspace"></span><<span class="thinspace"></span>18 months) during summer 2008. The occurrence of young air masses (<<span class="thinspace"></span>6 months) at the top of the Asian monsoon anticyclone up to &approx;<span class="thinspace"></span>460<span class="thinspace"></span>K is in agreement with satellite measurements of chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22) by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) instrument. HCFC-22 can be considered as a regional tracer for continental eastern Asia and the Near East as it is mainly emitted in this region. </p> <p>Our findings show that the transport pathway of air masses from boundary sources in the region of the Asian monsoon into the tropical pipe occurs in three distinct steps. First, very fast uplift in <q>a convective range</q> transports air masses up to 360<span class="thinspace"></span>K potential temperature within a few days. Second, air masses are uplifted from about 360<span class="thinspace"></span>K up to 460<span class="thinspace"></span>K within <q>an upward spiralling range</q> within a few months. The large-scale upward spiral extends from northern Africa to the western Pacific. The air masses are transported upwards by diabatic heating with a rate of up to 1&ndash;1.5<span class="thinspace"></span>K per day, implying strong vertical transport above the Asian monsoon anticyclone. Third, transport of air masses occurs within the tropical pipe up to 550<span class="thinspace"></span>K associated with the large-scale Brewer&ndash;Dobson circulation within $\sim$<span class="thinspace"></span>one year.</p> <p>In the upward spiralling range, air masses are uplifted by diabatic heating across the (lapse rate) tropopause, which does not act as a transport barrier under these conditions. Further, in the upward spiralling range air masses from inside the Asian monsoon anticyclone are mixed with air masses convectively uplifted outside the core of the Asian monsoon anticyclone in the tropical adjacent regions. However, this upward transport is weak in terms of transported air masses compared to the quasi-horizontal transport from the monsoon anticyclone into the northern lower stratosphere and tropical tropopause region. Air masses from the Asian monsoon anticyclone (India/China) contribute a minor fraction to the composition of air within the tropical pipe at 550<span class="thinspace"></span>K (6<span class="thinspace"></span>%), the major fractions are from Southeast Asia (16<span class="thinspace"></span>%) and the tropical Pacific (15<span class="thinspace"></span>%).</p>},

This chapter reviews and updates the state of knowledge on indoor aerosols with a focus on their behaviour, physicochemical properties and implications for health assessment studies. It begins with a brief outline of fundamental aerosol dynamics (i.e. deposition, coagulation, evaporation and nucleation) and the main factors that control and affect the concentration and behaviour of aerosols indoors. It then summarizes the concentrations and physicochemical profiles of aerosols in different major indoor sources and microenvironments such as homes, offices and schools. Implications of particle properties for lung dose calculations are discussed. Based on this work, it is concluded that indoor aerosols show a range of particle size distributions and chemical compositions, depending on different indoor emissions and aerosol indoor dynamics. Household aerosols are identified as a main contributor to the total and regional lung dose of ambient particles, especially when expressed by number dose.},

	abstract     = {Some phthalates, which are used mainly as plasticizers, are suspected to be endocrine disruptors. In the present study, daily intakes of phthalates by Japanese children through all exposure pathways and the contribution of indoor air quality to the intakes were examined by measuring urinary phthalate metabolites in the children and the airborne phthalates in their residences. Spot urine samples excreted first after waking up in the morning were collected from the subjects aged 6 to 15 years (n = 132), and airborne phthalates were sampled in the subjects' bedrooms for 24 h. Eight airborne phthalates and their urinary metabolites were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The daily intakes of the phthalates estimated were as follows (median, $\mu$g/kg b.w./day): dimethyl phthalate (DMP), 0.15; diethyl phthalate (DEP), 0.42; diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), 1.1; di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), 2.2; dicyclohexyl phthalate (DcHP), 0.026; benzylbutyl phthalate (BBzP), 0.032; di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), 6.3. The 95th percentile (21 $\mu$g/kg b.w./day) of the DEHP intakes exceeded the reference doses (RfD, 20 $\mu$g/kg b.w./day) of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). DEHP was suggested to be the most notable phthalate from the perspective of adverse effects on the health of Japanese children. On the other hand, DcHP and di-n-hexyl phthalate were not considered to be very important as indoor air pollutants and as internal contaminants for the children. The contribution rates of the amounts absorbed by inhalation to the amounts absorbed via all of the exposure pathways were only 7.9, 4.4, 6.6, 3.2, 0.22, and 1.0% as the median for DMP, DEP, DiBP, DnBP, BBzP, and DEHP, respectively. Therefore, inhalation did not seem to contribute very much as an absorption pathway of the phthalates for Japanese children while at home.},

In this review, procedures of relevance to model development are outlined. Simulations of zero and one-dimensional configurations have been performed over a wide range of conditions, including addition of H2, CO2 and H2O, and the results are used in a final recommendation about the use of the different mechanisms. The aim of this review is to put focus on the importance of an informed choice of kinetic mechanism to obtain accurate results at a reasonable computational cost. It is shown that for flame simulations, a reduced mechanism with only 42 irreversible reactions gives excellent agreement with experimental data, using only 5% of the computational time as compared to the widely used GRI-Mech 3.0. The reduced mechanisms are highly suitable for flame simulations, while for ignition they tend to react too slow, giving longer than expected ignition delay time. For combustible mixtures with addition of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or water, the detailed as well as reduced mechanisms generally show as good performance as for the corresponding simulations of pure methane/air mixtures.},
